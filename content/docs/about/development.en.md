# Development

## AirlineSim

The development of the original game began back in January 2002. Five years later, simulogics was founded and what started out as a hobby soon turned into a full-fledged game project. Over the years, AirlineSim has seen a lot of progress, including game world releases, in-game improvements and last but not least, a steadily growing community.

## AirlineSim Technology Demonstrator

In December 2021, the team announced a project called the AirlineSim Technology Demonstrator (ASTD). The ASTD is a prototype that is meant to explore what the game can look like given today's technological possibilities, making it a foundation for the future development of AirlineSim.

The prototype will focus on enhancing one of the game's core features, the [Online Reservation System (ORS)]({{< relref "docs/advanced/bookings/online-reservation-system/index.md" >}}), and developing it into a Distribution System (DS) that simulates real-life concepts such as interlining, booking classes and fare codes. This should enable players to run different types of airlines and set their companies apart from the competition.

**Info**  
Since the ASTD is a prototype, many of the game's current features will not be available. Still, players with premium accounts will be able to try it out as soon as the project moves into its open development phase.

The overall project is made possible in part by the game development funding program of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and is planned to run until mid 2023.
