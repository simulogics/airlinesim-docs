# Game Worlds

After logging into your account, the Dashboard will show a variety of game worlds for you to choose from. The amount of game worlds that you can join isn't limited, so feel free to try out as many as you like. Keep in mind that [credits]({{< relref "docs/about/payment/index.md" >}}) will be deducted from your account for every active game world.

You can find a list of all currently available game worlds, including their respective configurations, on [our website](https://www.airlinesim.aero/worlds).
