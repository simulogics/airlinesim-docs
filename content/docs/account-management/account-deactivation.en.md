**Warning**  
An account deactivation affects both your AirlineSim and Prosperous Universe account.

In case you only want to remove your account from an AirlineSim game world, just navigate to the world's Settings tab and click on Deactivation. This will irreversibly delete all of your account's holdings and subsidiaries, so please read the details provided on the page carefully before proceeding. Your central user account remains unaffected by this.
