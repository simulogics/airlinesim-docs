# Payments

This article is meant to help you with possible questions regarding the payment process for AirlineSim credits. 

## Missing Payment Methods

Right now, AirlineSim offers five different payment methods during checkout:

* Credit or Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express)
* PayPal
* paysafecard
* Online Bank Transfer
* Prepayment
* All payment methods offered by Steam (when playing through Steam)

Which ones are available to you can depend on your country as well as the credit package you picked. If a payment method doesn't show up, try selecting another package size.

## Voucher Code Not Redeemable

If you enter a voucher code during checkout and receive an error that prevents you from redeeming it, please contact the [AirlineSim support team](https://www.airlinesim.aero/blog/pages/support/).
