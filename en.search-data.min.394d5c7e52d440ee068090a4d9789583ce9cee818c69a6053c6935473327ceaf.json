What\u0026rsquo;s that about, you ask?\nAlliances are formal business cooperation agreements between a number of companies. They add a taste of reality to the game and are a great way to enjoy AirlineSim with your fellow players. The goals of an alliance, its membership criteria and other formalities are decided internally by its members.\nSome alliances \u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo; extra hubs by interlining and flying at the same time to the same airport. Others help their members by purchasing shares if they go public, operate their own helpdesk to advise new members or set up certain rules.\nAs you can see, the possibilities are endless: From friendly chat to fully realized interlining agreements - a good alliance can offer all of that and more!\nHow can I join? # If you want to join an alliance, you have several options: You can create an alliance as a founding member, be invited or apply for membership. Note that a company can only be part of one alliance at a time: If you\u0026rsquo;re already a member of an alliance, you have to leave before you can apply to join another.\nFounding an Alliance # In order to create a new alliance, three founding members are needed - yourself and two others. In the New Alliance menu of the Commercial tab, enter the name of your alliance, its headquarters and the names of the second and third founding members.\nThe first founding member is the one that sets up the alliance. The two others will be notified and can approve or reject the request. An alliance is formed once all founding members have agreed.\nApplying for Membership # If you\u0026rsquo;re planning to join an existing alliance, have a look at its information page (you can access a list of the available alliances in the Database tab). Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a membership application form (not visible if you are already a member of an alliance).\nThe information you enter here helps the alliance members to decide on your application. You can also ask what their alliance does, what they like about it or how members help each other. This way, you know what to expect if you join.\nAfter submitting your request, all current members will receive a message about the application and must vote. If the majority approves, you\u0026rsquo;re officially a member!\nManaging Alliances # Once you\u0026rsquo;re part of an alliance, you can contribute as a member, a manager or a director.\nMembers are limited to participating in discussions and decisions concerning the admission of new members. Managers can change the informational text and logo for an alliance. A director has access to a dedicated Director tab and can appoint managers, delegate responsibility, expel members or resign and nominate a successor.\nManagement tasks can only be performed by managers or directors. They can customize the alliance by adding a company profile as well as a large and small logo. The small logo can have a size of up to 23 x 23 pixels and will be displayed on arrival and departure boards for all flights of the alliance\u0026rsquo;s members.\nAlliance Overview # You can find more details regarding an alliance by looking up its information page.\nThe Overview section lists all alliance members together with their status and a geographical display of their hubs. If you\u0026rsquo;re part of an alliance, any outstanding membership applications will be shown here as well. Remember that each member has one opportunity to vote and the more members the alliance has, the more votes must be cast.\nThe Facts and Figures tab shows a summary of combined statistical information for all alliance members, such as revenue, transported passengers and cargo.\nThe Flight Schedule section displays the members\u0026rsquo; combined flight plans.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/en/docs/user-interface/company-overview/","title":"Company Overview","section":"User Interface","content":" Company Overview # Hovering over your company\u0026rsquo;s name at the top left of the screen provides you with several options regarding your enterprise.\nOverview # The dashboard is separated into seven parts (also called widgets) - Company, Upcoming Events, Notepad, Stock, Financial Rating, Image and Subsidiaries - and is handy to look up quick information about your company.\nCompany # The Company widget displays the logo (if you uploaded one) as well as the most important information about the enterprise, such as its name, code, hub, home country, airline rating, fleet size and number of employees. By clicking on Info Page, you can access your company\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise page.\nUpcoming Events # In the Upcoming Events widget, you can see your fixed expenses and income of the next three days based on contracts and terminated events like aircraft deliveries. The week-end closing is the time when your financial period resets and when staff are paid.\nInfo\nThese events don\u0026rsquo;t belong to the direct costs of a flight. To extend the list, click on View Complete Financial Schedule or select Cash Flow in the Management tab. Notepad # This widget allows you to write down notes regarding your enterprise. You can see them as long as you\u0026rsquo;re logged into AirlineSim. To add or edit a note, double click it. The note will only be displayed to you - no other player can see it.\nStock # If an enterprise makes an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the Stock widget displays information like the stock quote and an overview of the shareholders. Clicking on IPO Information leads you to a page showing the stock data in detail (which can also be accessed via Corporate Finance in the Management tab).\nFinancial Rating # This section shows a simplified version of your airline\u0026rsquo;s economics: The Cash Flow indicates how much money the airline is making; the Profit Margin represents the amount of profit you earn in relation to the revenue. All the listed factors are summed up in the Overall Rating.\nImage # This widget displays your airline\u0026rsquo;s current image regarding the three booking classes (Economy, Business, First) and cargo. The higher the green bar, the more your customers like your product. In order to keep track, you can see both the current and last week\u0026rsquo;s image as well as the overall trend.\nSubsidiaries # In this widget, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a list of all the subsidiaries you are controlling as the main shareholder. Further details on stocks can also be reviewed on the Subsidiaries \u0026amp; Portfolio page in the Management tab.\nSettings (General) # If you click on Settings right below the Overview option, you can edit the following details:\nPublic Information # This is the text that other users see when they visit your airline\u0026rsquo;s overview page. Most players use it to inform about interlining specifications or their company\u0026rsquo;s milestones.\nMain Logo # Here, you can upload a logo for your company. The logo will appear in your airline overview and is purely cosmetic. The file must have a size of 300 x 100 pixels. If you want to delete your logo, just click on the small trash can icon.\nSmall Logo # You can add a smaller version of your logo which will be displayed throughout the game (on arrival and departure billboards, for example). This image must have a size of 120 x 23 pixels. Please make sure it also complies with our logo guidelines (available under Database \u0026gt; Naming Rules in any game world) and keep in mind that the design will need to be approved by multiple moderators before being activated.\nSettings (Game) # Next to the General Settings, you\u0026rsquo;ll find another tab with Game Settings. This allows you to personalize AirlineSim by overwriting some of its global settings. A similar menu is available in the Settings tab on the top right of the screen.\nTime and Time Zones # You can choose whether the times in AirlineSim should be shown as the hub time, local time or UTC. The selection affects all displayed times within the game, such as slots, timetables and the financial schedule.\nComfort Functions # The Comfort Functions allow you to determine whether the game should handle certain tasks automatically. These can include:\nPicking a maintenance provider when a new enterprise is founded, creating a default service profile when a new enterprise is founded, assigning a default seating configuration to new aircraft (only if defined), creating a standardized seating configuration if no default has been specified and assigning crew to new aircraft. As these settings affect your gameplay, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to adjust them to your liking.\nFlight Planning and Route Management # Here, you can specify details related to flight numbers, aircraft scheduling, boarding methods, cargo and baggage as well as a few other options.\nNotifications # This lets you determine which in-game notifications you want to receive from AirlineSim.\nSystem Settings # Use this menu to choose whether or not you want to receive email notifications when someone sends you an in-game message.\nUser Interface # In this section, you can adjust the game\u0026rsquo;s visuals by choosing between a Dark, Light and Classic theme. You can also define settings regarding color blindness accessibility as well as some other interface related options.\nCompany Setup and Liquidation # Underneath the settings, you have the option to create a new enterprise or to liquidate your current one.\nWarning If you choose a liquidation, all data of your enterprise will be irreversibly removed. All assets will be sold, buildings will be demolished, existing minority stakes will go to AirlineSim and majority stakes will lead to the deletion of the daughter enterprise. The shareholder will receive the remaining values divided by their share. Keep in mind that a reset is only possible for holdings (i.e. enterprises which belong to your account directly).\nEnterprise # The Enterprise page provides information regarding a specific company. You can access it by using the Info page link on your company\u0026rsquo;s dashboard or by entering the company name into the search bar.\nOverview # This section shows the most important details like the company\u0026rsquo;s name, hub and rating as well as its route network, fleet, subsidiaries, published information, statistics and news.

Using that, you can acquire planes and become an operational enterprise. However, you can also use your funds (or parts of them) to create a subsidiary. In that case, your subsidiary can lease or buy planes and operate your airline. So what\u0026rsquo;s the difference?\nYour holding is the parent investment firm for all of your business ventures and limits your transportation rights (depending on the country where it was founded). It will always remain your property, so you can\u0026rsquo;t sell it or sell shares.\nIf you create a subsidiary, you can go public and sell shares of your airline on the stock market. With your IPO (Initial Public Offering) you can attract fresh capital and still own 80% of the subsidiary afterwards.\nAs the capital injection allows you to grow faster, going public gives your company a boost. However, you have to pay a weekly dividend equal to 15% of your profit to your shareholders (if you don\u0026rsquo;t go public, the subsidiary remains in your possession and no dividend is paid).\nSince your holding owns 80% of the shares, 80% of the dividend goes to your holding. You can buy back shares as they become available or your holding can sell more of its 80% shares to the public. It\u0026rsquo;s not possible to move money between a holding and a subsidiary, not even if you own 100% of the subsidiary shares.\nInfo\nIf you buy shares of another airline, you get detailed information regarding their operations, so it can be interesting to buy a few shares from your main competitors. Apart from IPOs, creating a subsidiary can be interesting if you want to have more than three maintenance families of planes or a dedicated enterprise for intercontinental flights and cargo divisions. If your holding buys planes and leases them to a subsidiary, you can even move parts of its profit to the holding.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/en/docs/beginners-guide/introduction/","title":"Introduction","section":"Beginner's Guide","content":" Your First Airline # You\u0026rsquo;re new to the game and want to know how to get started with your business venture?

If you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough payload, you need another plane making profit in order to cover for the losses. However, this means that you invested money in two planes and the net result is still zero.\nExample\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that you have a plane with 100 seats and the point where you break even is at around 70%. This means that 70 passengers will allow you to barely survive, 80 passengers will give you a 10% profit, 90 passengers will provide a 20% profit and a full plane will give you a profit of 30%. Every route and plane is different, but the numbers above are pretty close, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to aim high. Try to keep your average load factor at around 90% or above.\nYou can keep an eye on your airline\u0026rsquo;s performance by navigating to the Commercial tab and selecting Load Monitoring. Here, you can check loads for a time span, route, fleet and flight number group of your choice.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for ways to increase your load factors, you may be thinking about selling cheaper tickets. However, dropping prices doesn\u0026rsquo;t always work. In the real world, low prices can attract new passengers that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t fly otherwise. In the game, the number of passengers is fixed.\nSo what are your options if cheaper tickets don\u0026rsquo;t fill your plane?\nCheck the flight schedule: Do your planes arrive and leave your hub in waves? Have you taken the minimum transfer times into account? Good connections usually improve your load factors. Optimize your service: Have you assigned a service profile to your flight? Few passengers will board your plane if there is no on-board service. Connect with interlining partners: If you have an interlining partner at the destination airport, make sure to connect your flights with theirs. If the load factors still don\u0026rsquo;t improve, try looking for a more profitable route. Exception: Your plane is only half full but most passengers are transfer passengers. In that case, you better lease a smaller plane to operate that route.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/fleet/maintenance-categories/","title":"Maintenance Categories","section":"Fleet Management","content":" Maintenance Categories # Every aircraft type in AirlineSim has a distinct maintenance category which describes its capability of being maintained together with similar types, e.g. an Airbus A318 together with an A319, A320 or A321. This refers to similar needs regarding training and equipment due to technical similarities between the planes. You can check which category an aircraft belongs to by having a look at its fact sheet.\nWhile an A320 and an A318 do not differ much, a Boeing 737 is a wholly different plane with different requirements. So maintenance categories actually reflect a loss in maintenance productivity when diversifying one\u0026rsquo;s fleet which is why it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep track of how many categories your aircraft belong to.\nYour first three maintenance categories are \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo;, meaning that you pay a flat fee of 100% base maintenance costs. The fourth category raises maintenance costs by 15%, the fifth adds another 15% to 130%, and so on. This figure refers to all of your planes.\nBought and leased out planes do not count towards your maintenance category limits.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/bookings/online-reservation-system/","title":"Online Reservation System","section":"Bookings","content":" Online Reservation System # As one of the game\u0026rsquo;s core features, the Online Reservation System (ORS) generates a multitude of daily connections and distributes passengers between the players\u0026rsquo; flights.\nFlights are put into the ORS three days before they take off. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you activate a flight plan on Monday morning and the first flight is scheduled to take off at 11 o\u0026rsquo;clock. In that case, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until 11 o\u0026rsquo;clock before your first flight appears on the flight list. If you activated your flight plan with a three day delay, it won\u0026rsquo;t appear until Thursday morning.\nAfter that, new flights will be added to the list as time progresses. One flight at the time, and always three days ahead. Every airport calculates its passenger demand once a day (you can find the specific time on the airport\u0026rsquo;s information page under Demand Calculation). When that happens, your flight will be compared to the other available flights and passengers will book tickets.\nIf you activate your flight schedule without a delay, passengers will only have one day to book your first flight. If you activate it with a three day delay, your flight will be checked three consecutive days, so passengers have three days to book tickets. On an average route, your flight will gradually fill up over the three days. On a very busy route, a plane may well be fully booked after one day. If there is little demand, your plane may still be half empty after three days.\nWhen the ORS checks your flight, it balances seats, on-board service, terminals and the image of your airline against the price. This value for money ratio decides the rating of your flight. A high rating means that passengers will prefer your flight. A low rating means they will prefer to fly with your competitors (if their rating is higher).\nIn the ORS, the rating is represented through green bars (the exact value can be revealed by hovering over them), which makes it a handy tool to keep track of your flight performance.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/en/docs/account-management/account-creation/","title":"Signing Up","section":"Account Management","content":" Signing Up # Before accessing the game, you need to set up an account by selecting the Login button on the AirlineSim website.

Make sure to follow the naming conventions in order to keep the game enjoyable for everyone.\nYou will also be prompted to enter a code for your company. The code must contain two or three letters or digits but shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a number. Since it can\u0026rsquo;t be used by another enterprise, the interface will show a warning if a code is already taken. Keep in mind that this code can\u0026rsquo;t be changed later on.\nChoosing a Country # Next, let\u0026rsquo;s determine your airline\u0026rsquo;s headquarters. Keep in mind that the country you pick will influence the traffic rights that apply to your holding and its subsidiaries, so choose carefully. It may also affect your aircraft fleet: If you start an airline in a remote location, you will need big and expensive planes to connect your hub to the world unless you don’t mind limiting yourself to more regional routes.\nIn the beginning, it\u0026rsquo;s recommendable to select a country with little competition so that your planes are easier to fill. If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure about the situation in a specific country, review some of its existing companies by checking their ratings and general activity in the game. In regards to the city, it can be helpful to select a country\u0026rsquo;s capital as it is usually a popular destination for passengers.\nWhen joining a game world that has already been running for some time, it can\u0026rsquo;t hurt to take a look at the available slots of your desired airport.\nInfo\nYou can look up the slot distribution for a specific airport by typing its name into the game\u0026rsquo;s search bar and navigating to the Slots tab of the airport\u0026rsquo;s info page. If you see a lot of orange and red, you may want to find another hub since slots are needed for landing and take off and play an important role in creating your flight schedule.\nTo help you with your decision, here are a few examples of different countries and their potential characteristics as hub locations.\nSpain # As a member of the EU, all of Europe is your domestic market, meaning you can transport passengers between any two airports within the EU (see Traffic Rights). The only issue: Every other European airline has the same advantage. All in all, Europe is a good place if you plan on creating several hubs, want loads of passengers and don\u0026rsquo;t mind the hard competition.\nUSA # Another huge market, big enough to create several hubs. As it is one country, you can fly to international destinations from every US airport. But, like in the EU, the competition can be quite strong.\nMexico # Mexico provides a decent domestic market as it has many airports and only Mexican airlines can transport passengers between them. You will face competition from foreign airlines on your international routes but your domestic routes should be more protected. Obviously, the domestic market is much smaller compared to the US.\nPakistan # This is an example for a country which can be open to foreign investors. At first, you may think you found a country with a good domestic market and little local competition.\nHowever, if it\u0026rsquo;s open to investors, every airline in the world can use it to create a subsidiary.

In doubt, check out the world\u0026rsquo;s configuration here or on our blog. If multiple holdings are allowed, keep in mind that cooperation between them is forbidden by our game rules. When setting up a subsidiary, you have to decide how much starting capital it will receive from your holding, the minimum being 3 million AS$. Consider how much you want to invest as you will not have the opportunity to transfer any more money from the holding to the company or vice versa, except through a dividend paid to your holding and outside investors after an IPO.\nApart from the starting capital, keep in mind that the country of your holding determines the traffic rights of its subsidiaries: If the hub of your daughter company is located in the same country as the holding, you will have full traffic rights, otherwise they may be limited.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/en/docs/account-management/account-deactivation/","title":"Deactivation","section":"Account Management","content":" Deactivation # If you ever decide to close your account, please send a support ticket via email so we can deactivate the account for you.\nWarning\nAn account deactivation affects both your AirlineSim and Prosperous Universe account.

Total travel time does affect the flight rating, though.\nDoes passenger demand vary seasonally? # No, seasonal changes currently don\u0026rsquo;t play a role when it comes to demand.\nDo passengers care which day they fly? # Passengers book flights only within the next three days, but will book any of those if some days are full or unavailable. If there are no flights available, those passengers never book a flight - they\u0026rsquo;ll have to drive, hitchhike or swim for this trip!\nCan I increase load factors by scheduling flights less often than once a day? # Yes, many routes with low demand can be served with flights that don\u0026rsquo;t occur everyday. This won\u0026rsquo;t work if you plan further than 3 days ahead, however, as passengers don\u0026rsquo;t consider flights that lie more than 3 days in the future.\nDo passengers have an exact destination in mind or are they flexible enough to pick nearby airports? # Passengers are generated with a demand to reach a specific airport. However, ground travel can form a component of a trip. See Flight Rating System for more details.\nIs there any way to translate the green demand blocks for each airport into an exact number of passengers that want to fly between them? # Nope!

Five years later, simulogics was founded and what started out as a hobby soon turned into a full-fledged game project. Over the years, AirlineSim has seen a lot of progress, including game world releases, in-game improvements and last but not least, a steadily growing community.\nAirlineSim Technology Demonstrator # In December 2021, the team announced a project called the AirlineSim Technology Demonstrator (ASTD). The ASTD is a prototype that is meant to explore what the game can look like given today\u0026rsquo;s technological possibilities, making it a foundation for the future development of AirlineSim.\nThe prototype will focus on enhancing one of the game\u0026rsquo;s core features, the Online Reservation System (ORS), and developing it into a Distribution System (DS) that simulates real-life concepts such as interlining, booking classes and fare codes. This should enable players to run different types of airlines and set their companies apart from the competition.\nInfo\nSince the ASTD is a prototype, many of the game\u0026rsquo;s current features will not be available. Still, players with premium accounts will be able to try it out as soon as the project moves into its open development phase. The overall project is made possible in part by the game development funding program of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and is planned to run until mid 2023.\nYou can find out more about the project\u0026rsquo;s details in the ASTD FAQ.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/fleet/fuel-consumption/","title":"Fuel Consumption","section":"Fleet Management","content":" Fuel Consumption # Fuel isn\u0026rsquo;t cheap. Every dollar you pay for fuel reduces your profit, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to use the right plane for the right route.\nIn the game, the two main factors regarding fuel consumption are fuel per flight and fuel per kilometer.\nThe fuel per flight (or per cycle) is used for taxiing, take-off, climbing to cruise altitude and landing. The fuel per kilometer covers the distance between the airports as long as that distance is less than the minimum range of the plane - flying further means carrying (and using) more fuel and transporting less passengers.\nExample\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that one plane needs 1,000 liters of fuel per cycle and 5 liters per kilometer, while another plane requires 2,000 liters per cycle and 3 liters per kilometer. In that case, the first plane will be cheaper if the distance is less than 500 km, but the second plane will be more profitable on longer routes. If you use the Aircraft Type Evaluation tool, make sure you check multiple destinations! "},{"id":16,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/alliances-and-interlining/interlining/","title":"Interlining","section":"Alliances and Interlining","content":" Interlining # Another way of forming connections with other players is through interlining. This concept refers to agreements between airlines regarding passenger transfers; specifically, the ability for passengers to transfer between flights operated by airlines which have interlining agreements.\nThis is a pretty complicated business in reality, but a simplified model is used in AirlineSim.\nHow to Get Started # In order for passenger transfers between flights operated by two different airlines to occur, an interlining contract must be signed. These contracts currently encompass the entire networks of the involved airlines - there are no restrictions regarding particular airports or routes.\nTo set up an interlining agreement, you can use the Interlining page, accessible from the Commercial tab, or the Send Interlining Request button on an airline\u0026rsquo;s overview page.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve received confirmation of the other airline\u0026rsquo;s acceptance, the two route networks will be linked immediately and passengers and freight can transfer between the flights of your companies.\nInfo\nThe same transfer rules apply as would to transfers between your own flights, so you should still consider the airports\u0026rsquo; minimum transfer times and avoid letting passengers wait for more than eight hours (the maximum waiting time depends on the server, so it may be longer on future game worlds). Choosing a Partner # Naturally, there are some costs involved in this process. Interlining contracts may allow you to sell more tickets, but also require the employment of a number of extra network planning personnel (with a minimum of one employee per airline and contract and, if large airlines are involved, potentially many more).\nTherefore, it\u0026rsquo;s worth thinking about the value of extra traffic generated versus the value of maintaining an interlining contract, particularly with a very large airline.\nBefore accepting an interlining agreement, it can be helpful to consider where your interlining partner is located, whether their routes fit your network and if their flights appear on the Online Reservation System (ORS). Ideally, your partner communicates with you, has a good regional and international network and operates flights that get high ratings on the ORS.\nWhy is this important? Connected flights always get a lower rating than direct flights. If your partner\u0026rsquo;s (or your) flights have low ratings, the combined flights might not even appear on the ORS. In that case, passengers will prefer other ways to fly from A to B to C.\nExample\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume you\u0026rsquo;re based in Istanbul and want an interlining partner in London. If you and your partner only fly to major European capitals, you won\u0026rsquo;t gain a single passenger.\nIf your partner operates domestic and regional flights though, you\u0026rsquo;ll get extra passengers on your flights to London who take a connecting flight to Aberdeen or Glasgow.\nVice versa, you\u0026rsquo;ll get passengers who use your domestic flights from Ankara to Istanbul and then take a connecting flight to London.\nYour partner\u0026rsquo;s location is less important, but usually, a hub that\u0026rsquo;s far away from yours offers a lot of different destinations. However, you can also form a contract with companies that use the same hub as you.\nCancelling an Agreement # You can cancel the interlining contract at any time. In that case, it will run until the end of the accounting week in which the cancellation was requested.\nInternal Interlining # We\u0026rsquo;ve talked about the costs associated with interlining, however maintaining connections between your own flights isn\u0026rsquo;t free either! They are handled in the same way as external connections and require a number of staff to keep them running smoothly.\nThe Interlining page offers an option to turn networking administration on or off by checking or unchecking the Networking Enabled box.\nBear in mind that this will result in your passengers being unable to switch between your flights and may lead to a lower demand, particularly on marginal routes.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/en/docs/faqs/payments/","title":"Payments","section":"FAQs","content":" Payments # This article is meant to help you with possible questions regarding the payment process for AirlineSim credits.\nMissing Payment Methods # Right now, AirlineSim offers five different payment methods during checkout:\nCredit or Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) PayPal paysafecard Online Bank Transfer Prepayment All payment methods offered by Steam (when playing through Steam) Which ones are available to you can depend on your country as well as the credit package you picked.

They may hate you for it, but they will pay. However, you\u0026rsquo;re rarely the only available airline, so here are a few rules of thumb to guide you through the process of choosing ticket prices.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re offering decent seats and service, you can try selling tickets that lie 25% above the default price. Depending on the type of plane, that should result in a profit margin of around 30%.\nYou can also consider selling domestic flight tickets for a little more, especially if you are on speaking terms with your competitors. Internationally, the competition is often too complicated to negotiate pricing strategies. In that case, it comes down to trial and error and taking the time to check your routes.\nAnother tip is to look out for invisible competition: You may have loads of passengers on a route from airport A to your hub, but suddenly, their numbers go down although you see no competition.\nThis can happen if some of your passengers were only flying to your hub in order to catch a connecting flight to airport B. If another airline starts flying between airport A and B, passengers prefer a direct flight. Or perhaps the other airline also offers a connection from A to B through their hub, but at a cheaper price. As you can see, there are many possibilities, so try to keep an eye on the market.\nHelpful Tools # In case you\u0026rsquo;re still a bit unsure about your ticket prices, you can always rely on the game\u0026rsquo;s tools for guidance.\nThe Market Analysis page shows you a list of all bookable flights on a certain route. It tells you how much your competitors charge for a ticket and whether their flights are fully booked or not.\nThe Fleet List of a country (available in the Database tab) displays details regarding your competitors\u0026rsquo; cabin configurations. The number of seats for each class can be viewed in the Config. column and may give you an idea of the seat types they are using. If a player employs standard seats, they can afford to drop their prices; if they offer pricier seats, they can sell more expensive tickets and still be an attractive choice.\nThe Online Reservation System tells you which flights have the highest ratings. Obviously pricing is important, but the total time of a journey is taken into account as well. A short transfer time can make your flights more appealing to customers.\nAnalyzing the Competition # If you want to see how competing companies are doing, you can check out their stock market information (if they have gone public) and have a look at their weekly turn-over and profit margin.\nThe Statistics page may also be a useful source of information: Divide the number of passengers an airline transported last week by the number of seats they offered and you get their load factor.\nIf your competitor has a B rating, a profit margin of 5% and an average load factor of 75%, try lowering your prices until your planes are fully booked. If the opposite is the case, you may want to find a route that is more profitable.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/setup/traffic-rights/","title":"Traffic Rights","section":"Company Setup","content":" Traffic Rights # A critical aspect of the game is that airlines are national, not global, entities. Air traffic agreements between individual countries regulate the transport of passengers in the real world and AirlineSim represents this, albeit in a slightly simplified manner.\nWhat are Traffic Rights? # By Traffic Rights we mean the rules that determine whether you can fly passengers between two destinations. Your rights to serve a particular market are determined by the country in which your holding\u0026rsquo;s home base is located. For subsidiaries, the rights are usually based on the location of the holding as well (or the combined amount of shares held if your airline is a listed enterprise).\nExample\nIf your holding is based in Manila, the daughter enterprises will inherit its right to fly domestically between any airport pair in the Philippines, but will not be allowed to fly domestically in China. Hold on - I can add Chinese flights just fine! # Even with your holding based in the Philippines, there is nothing physically stopping our hypothetical airline from scheduling domestic flights in China; you may want the aircraft to depart from another airport on its return journey, for example. However, any flights scheduled in such a way will not receive passenger bookings.\nWell, where can I fly? # A good question - the answers will vary depending on where your holding is located. The following rules are universal and apply to holdings based in all countries:\nAny airline may transport passengers domestically (that is, between two points in the same country) in the country in which its holding is based.\nAny airline may transport passengers internationally between any point in its home country (the country where its holding is based) and any point in a second country.\nAny airline may transport passengers internationally between any point in one country and any point in another if the trip involves a stop (a take-off and a landing, at least) in the country in which its holding is based.\nIn addition to these universal rules, there are a couple of special cases:\nEuropean Union: Any airline whose holding is based in the European Union may transport passengers between any two points within the European Union by whatever routing desired; in other words, the European Union\u0026rsquo;s domestic market functions as one large, virtual country. Important: This rule does not apply to flights which either begin or end outside the European Union - any such flights must either begin or end in the country in which the airline\u0026rsquo;s holding is based.\nAustralia and New Zealand: Similarly, any airline whose holding is based in either Australia or New Zealand may transport passengers between any two points within both Australia and New Zealand; however, again, this rule does not apply to flights which either begin or end outside Australia and New Zealand.\nYamoussoukro Decision: Any airline whose holding is based in a country party to the Yamoussoukro Decision may transport passengers between a second and a third country if - and only if - the flight in question is a continuation of a flight from the holding\u0026rsquo;s country of origin, using the game\u0026rsquo;s via function.\nEU Treaty \u0026amp; Oceanic Open Skies # Yamoussoukro Decision \u0026amp; Caricom 5th Freedom # What about cargo flights? # The global cargo market operates on a completely liberalized basis, reflecting its somewhat more challenging nature. Airlines may transport cargo between any two points in the world, regardless of where their holding is based (unless there are political restrictions).\nWhat if I outgrow my domestic market? # There are several countries throughout the world which allow foreign investment; the previously stated rules apply to these countries as they do to any other, but unlike countries which don\u0026rsquo;t allow foreign investment, foreign holdings may - through the establishment of an enterprise based in the investment-open country - operate airlines in them, enjoying all the rights granted to domestic holdings.\nInfo\nWhether or not a country accepts foreign investments depends on the game world.

The ratings it provides are also used to calculate the influence a flight has on the airline\u0026rsquo;s image.\nThe evaluation can be accessed via the Inventory or Flight Numbers page in the Commercial tab. Just click on the small white arrow next to a flight and you\u0026rsquo;ll see its Flight Information page.\nThe ratings can be found in the Flight Rating tab and consist of two operationally separate components: Product and image factors. Both are listed together with the influence that the flight will have on the airline\u0026rsquo;s image.\nProduct Factors # Product factors describe an airline\u0026rsquo;s image taken as a whole. They influence passengers as they book their flights and consist of parameters like price, on-board service and seating quality.\nThe individual factors are weighted differently, depending on the class - Economy, Business, First or Cargo - and the flight\u0026rsquo;s distance: A passenger taking a short flight in Economy class will be significantly less picky than one flying halfway around the world in Business. And, as each class possesses its own image value, a great reputation for moving freight won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean anything to passengers!\nIn the Flight Rating tab, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the list of factors along with colored bars which represent their associated ratings: Green bars equal good or excellent product ratings; red bars indicate poor or lousy product ratings.\nImage Factors # Image factors include a bit less tangible aspects than product factors. Each completed flight affects your airline\u0026rsquo;s image - how exactly depends on the \u0026ldquo;soft\u0026rdquo; factors of the flight like the amount of room, the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s condition and the staff\u0026rsquo;s mood, which makes investment (or lack of it!) in these areas a significant factor in differentiating airlines.\nThe image is formed over time, based on the subjective experiences of passengers after they\u0026rsquo;ve completed their flights. This is why decisions have long-term effects: An airline that transitions from flying ancient, uncomfortable aircraft to comfortable, modern aircraft overnight will not see an immediate change in the average passenger\u0026rsquo;s opinion of them.\nFlight Rating # The overall Flight Rating derives from evaluating both of the above-mentioned factors. This rating is then set against the price of the flight to produce a value called the Price Performance Ratio (PPR). This only directly affects passengers flying between the two evaluated destinations - a positive PPR will, generally speaking, attract at least some traffic, whereas a negative PPR will not.\nBear in mind, however, that connection options at either end of the flight may improve the PPR of two flights combined sufficiently for passengers to book a sector with a negative PPR. Factors such as the time spent transferring between flights and the total flight time will be taken into account when calculating connections.\nGround Connections # Ground connections - that is, passenger travel by car, bus, train etc. - are almost always available and are considered the baseline value for any individual flight or connection evaluation. They have a neutral PPR by default; consequently, flights or connections with a PPR below that of ground transportation usually won\u0026rsquo;t receive any passengers.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/en/docs/about/game-worlds/","title":"Game Worlds","section":"About AirlineSim","content":" Game Worlds # After logging into your account, the Dashboard will show a variety of game worlds for you to choose from.

With some possible routes in mind, you can get a better idea of what your fleet is going to look like.\nDomestic Routes # Domestic routes and flights to smaller regional airports feed transfer passengers to your hub and usually don\u0026rsquo;t exceed a length of 1,000 km. If you choose to operate these routes with smaller turboprops like the Dash 8, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that they are slower than jets. This can be neglected when it comes to short distances, though. Besides, bigger planes need more time to load / unload. And if time is not an issue, money is.\nKeep in mind that smaller aircraft can be cheap but at the same time at a disadvantage on high density routes due to their size. Sometimes, limited slots can be more important than saving fuel!\nMedium Routes # The majority of planes will do fine on routes between 1,000 and 2,000 km. You could go for a Boeing 737 or the Airbus 318-321 family, for example. Both offer several types with different payloads and ranges. If you want to save fuel, you could pick a 737-700 BGW as it has the lowest fuel consumption on medium range routes.\nOnce you hire a crew, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that one pilot can operate both an A318 and an A320. The same goes for the engineer who does the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s maintenance.\nLong-Haul Routes # As a new airline, it\u0026rsquo;s not advised to start by operating long-haul routes. Usually, you only have 10 million AS$ to start with and it can be difficult to run a profitable airline with only two (big and expensive) planes and a network that consists of only 4 destinations.\nInstead, you could begin by offering short- and medium-haul flights. Your starting capital should cover 1 or 2 medium sized jets and 3 or 4 turboprop planes, leaving you with a little reserve. Every plane can then fly 3 or 4 return trips per day, allowing you to create a small network from the start.\nNew vs. Used Aircraft # With some potential routes in mind, you can also start thinking about whether you want to equip your fleet with new or used aircraft. It\u0026rsquo;s generally recommended to start out with used aircraft as a new airline, both due to the limited starting funds and the immediate availability of the aircraft.\nHere are a few points to consider:\nFuel consumption / maintenance: New aircraft are likely to consume less fuel and are cheaper to maintain than their older counterparts.\nPassenger preference: Older aircraft (especially if \u0026gt; 20 years old) usually aren\u0026rsquo;t very attractive for customers, so choosing new planes should allow you to sell more tickets and charge higher prices. However, age isn\u0026rsquo;t the only factor: Generally, passengers prefer jets to props and large aircraft to smaller ones.\nProduction periods: Remember to check if an aircraft is still in production. Buying aircraft that were only produced in small numbers may complicate your operations down the road with regards to fleet commonality.\nDelivery times: If you\u0026rsquo;re not using your 10 million AS$ starting capital, new aircraft ordered from the manufacturer may not be delivered instantly as production takes between 6 - 42 hours, depending on the aircraft type. Used aircraft can be available immediately. (If you order several new aircraft from one production line, the orders will be added to your order book. This will not be influenced by other companies except for those belonging to your holding. The delivery date will be displayed in your fleet overview and in the order book. You can access the order book by navigating to the Operators section on the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s page.)\nPrice: Used aircraft are cheaper to buy or lease - sometimes significantly so, depending on the age of the aircraft.\nAircraft Type Evaluation # Looking Up Aircraft # After giving the possible aircraft types some thought, you can start looking into their details by navigating to the Management tab and selecting Aircraft Manufacturers. This page shows you all the available aircraft types grouped by manufacturer.\nSelecting a type opens an overview of the related aircraft variants and their general data, displaying values like speed, range and maximum passengers. If you want to know more about one of the models, just click on it and its aircraft fact sheet will give you all of the relevant specifications.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at some of the sheet\u0026rsquo;s data in detail:\nPassengers (max): The maximum passenger capacity of the aircraft. This can only be achieved with a one-class cabin layout using basic seats. If you want to offer more classes or luxurious seating, the aircraft will hold less passengers. Keep in mind to ask yourself how big your plane needs to be. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t require an A380 to fly between two tiny cities, for example. If you’re unsure, you can always check out what the competition is doing.\nRange: The smaller value shows the range that you can reach with a full payload. The higher value displays the maximum range which can only be accomplished at a minimum load. You can see the payload-range graph for a specific route by using the Performance Check Tool, about which we\u0026rsquo;ll talk in a second.\nGround roll take off / landing: The runway length the aircraft needs. The smaller value is the shortest possible length for take off or landing; the higher value is necessary for a fully-loaded take off or landing.\nNoise category: This indicates the noise emission level of an aircraft and can range from I (very noisy) to V (very quiet). Noisier aircraft pay higher ground charges and may be banned from certain airports entirely.\nMaintenance category: Aircraft within the same category have similar requirements regarding maintenance. Keep in mind that maintaining a diverse fleet can become expensive: Once your fleet contains aircraft from more than 3 categories, maintenance will cost an extra 15% for each added category.\nPerformance Check Tool # If you want to see how an aircraft performs on a specific route, have a look at the Performance Check Tool at the bottom of the sheet\u0026rsquo;s Technical Specification section.\nHere, you can find all the relevant information regarding a chosen aircraft and route, such as\ntechnical limitations (runway lengths, distance, route restrictions), details on fuel consumption and maximum payload, flight / turnaround times and air traffic control and airport fees. This allows you to check whether your planned destinations are within the reach of your plane and provide sufficient runway lengths, for example. Be careful, though: Flying longer ranges will use more fuel, so you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to carry as many passengers.\nSpeaking of fuel: Remember that fuel consumption is not linear - it takes a lot of effort to get a large, heavy plane off the ground, but not as much to keep it in the air once it\u0026rsquo;s up, so aircraft that are suitable for long flights may not be as fitting once the range gets low.\nComparing Aircraft Types # If you want to compare different aircraft types at once, click on the link below the Performance Check Tool. This lets you check the details of up to 4 aircraft models simultaneously.\nFor a comparison between an unlimited number of aircraft types on a selected route, navigate to the Operations tab and click on Aircraft Type Evaluation. Here, you can review the fuel consumption, the amount of available seats as well as the route\u0026rsquo;s costs.\nKeep an eye on the displayed number of flights, though: As an example, the tool may indicate that a plane can only carry out 28 flights per week (2 return flights per day), but you may be able to squeeze in a third (and shorter) flight (if you chose a more time efficient maintenance contractor, for instance).\nAcquiring Aircraft # Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve decided on an aircraft type, it\u0026rsquo;s time to acquire your first machine!\nThe aircraft fact sheet of your chosen model gives you the option to order new aircraft (if they are still in production) or check out used aircraft offers.\nOrdering New Aircraft # If you want to order new aircraft, just enter the desired amount and hit Request Quotation. On the following page, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the choice between various payment options:\nPurchasing aircraft directly by paying the full price right away.\nLeasing aircraft by putting down a security deposit and paying a weekly fee to the lessor. If you choose this option, your company must have an adequate credit rating. If you can\u0026rsquo;t pay the weekly fee, the aircraft will be returned automatically.\nMaking a loan purchase by financing the aircraft fully or in part through a credit. The loan and the interest must be paid back according to the game\u0026rsquo;s standard conditions. This payment method depends on your credit rating as well. All available plans will be automatically offered.\nAs you\u0026rsquo;ve just founded your first holding, you are usually equipped with a starting capital of 10 million AS$ that allows you to have aircraft delivered instantly if you lease them. Once you exceed this budget, you will have to wait some time as the aircraft will be delivered one after another. Production times can vary and are displayed on the aircraft fact sheet.\nOrdering Used Aircraft # If you want to order used machines, select Check Out Used Aircraft Offers at the top right of the aircraft fact sheet. This will lead you to the Aircraft Market page which displays all the used aircraft that can be acquired.\nThe used market allows you to make an immediate purchase or place a bid using either cash, a credit or leasing as your financing type. Even though it may take a while, bidding is often advised as it is usually much cheaper.\nImportant\nIf you place a bid, your money will remain tied up until the auction is finished. Keep in mind that the auction timer resets every time another bid is placed. Each aircraft on the market is listed with additional information:\nOwner: This shows you who owns the aircraft and who you will be leasing or buying it from. Oftentimes it will be the Aircraft Trade and Leasing Organization, a company run by the game. Registration: The registration code of the aircraft. Age: The age of an aircraft. This is important since older planes have higher maintenance but tend to be cheaper. Condition: The optimal condition of an aircraft lies at around 100% but the value usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as it can be increased once the machine is purchased. Location: This shows the current location of the aircraft. Keep in mind that you will need to transfer it to your base of operations. Buying or Leasing? # Most new companies begin their operations with leased aircraft. With the exception of very small or old machines, a direct purchase is often not financially viable for beginners. Additionally, leasing provides you with the flexibility to return aircraft you may find unsuitable for your routes. On the other hand, purchasing a plane allows you to avoid the weekly leasing fee. The bank will easily give you a loan if you have assets (in this case planes) to cover the risk.\nTerminating a Lease # Both you and the lessor have the ability to cancel the leasing contract at any time. If you wish to cancel a lease, go to the Operations tab and choose Fleet Management, navigate to the aircraft in question and click on the small book icon saying Contract Details.\nPlease note: The aircraft will be returned to the lessor once the next weekly installment is due. You will receive your bond back and will be charged the final lease installment.\nAny flights scheduled after the termination period will be canceled and cancellation fees will be charged for any passengers / cargo booked. Pilots and flight attendants will remain as redundant personnel until you retrain / reuse them or lay them off.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/finances/initial-public-offerings/","title":"Initial Public Offerings","section":"Finances","content":" Initial Public Offerings # Some game worlds allow players to perform an IPO, which stands for Initial Public Offering. At least two weeks after establishing an enterprise, you may apply for a quotation on the AirlineSim stock market and start trading shares publicly.\nBasic Rules # Before we get started, here are some general rules and tips regarding IPOs and stock market transactions that mostly serve to protect new IPOs and avoid illegal actions:\nIPOs can only be subscribed to a maximum of 200% of the offered shares. One enterprise can only sign up to 33% of the offered stakes within an IPO. Each enterprise that signs an IPO has to prove a significantly increased equity / share capital. The initial starting capital is not part of this. The stock rate follows a given base rate, tied closely to the company value, and gives a rough prognosis on the company\u0026rsquo;s development. Stock rate changes through trade will only be possible within +/- 10% of the base rate. Submitting an IPO # When performing an IPO, shares amounting to 25% (before the IPO) or 20% (after the IPO) of your enterprise\u0026rsquo;s value will be offered for subscription to potential investors from other enterprises. The shares will be traded at the local stock exchange under a stock symbol of your choice.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go public, navigate to the Corporate Finance page in the Management tab and choose a stock symbol of 3 to 6 letters and / or numbers. Then, submit your request by pressing the green button. Keep in mind that an IPO can\u0026rsquo;t be canceled afterwards, so proceed carefully.\nDividend Payouts # After submitting the IPO, you will have to pay out 15% of every week\u0026rsquo;s profits to your shareholders. Since the majority of all shares belongs to you (by default, you own 80%, unless you sold some shares separately after the IPO), most of these dividends will float back into your own holding or parent company\u0026rsquo;s pockets.\nInvesting # You\u0026rsquo;ll also be able to invest in IPOs of other players\u0026rsquo; enterprises. In that case, certain rules apply.\nGeneral Rules # If the stock price does not reach 50% (i.e. less than 50% of offered stocks have been signed up for), the IPO will not succeed and you will get a refund.\nBetween 50% and 100%, you will get your share of investment in the company. For example, if you invested in 25% of all offered stocks, you\u0026rsquo;ll receive a 5% stake in the enterprise (100% * 20% offered shares * 25% investment = 5%), each share valued at exactly 100 AS$.\nUp to 200%, you do get shares for the full value you invested, just less of them at a higher price.\nIf the quotation surpasses the 200% mark, you will receive your share in the whole investment, at 200 AS$, but only up to the 200% volume.\nExamples # Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of what happens when the quotation exceeds the 200% mark.\nIf the base share capital is 10 million AS$ (divided by 100 = 100,000 AS$ shares base float), you\u0026rsquo;ll have a target market capitalization of 12.5 million AS$ (+25%) at 100%. So the designated value to be signed is 2.5 million AS$ (12.5 million - 10 million AS$) and the upper border will be 200%, meaning you can sign up for a maximum value of 5 million AS$.\nThe enterprise launching the IPO will always keep 80% of all shares, so 20% are always to be distributed.\nScenario A 100% are signed, all by you:\nIf we continue with the example from above, you receive 25,000 shares at 100 AS$ per share in this scenario. The enterprise performing the IPO gets 2.5 million AS$, so you own 20% in the enterprise. The new overall book value for the enterprise will be 12.5 million AS$.\nScenario B 200% are signed, by you and another company (B):\nIn this case, you receive 12,500 shares at 200 AS$ per share. So does B. The enterprise performing the IPO receives 5 million AS$ and you own 10% in the enterprise. The new overall book value for the enterprise will be 15 million AS$.\nScenario C 250% are signed, by you and two other companies (you sign 100%, B 100% and C 50%):\nYou receive 10,000 shares (25,000 divided by 100% + 100% + 50%) at 200 AS$ and pay 2 million AS$ accordingly. The difference (500,000 AS$) will be refunded to your bank account.\nThe same goes for B, while C receives 5,000 shares at 200 AS$, paying 1 million AS$, getting a refund of 250,000 AS$. Your share in the new enterprise will be 8%. B also owns 8%, while C receives a share of 4%. The new overall book value for the enterprise will be 15 million AS$.\nImpairment \u0026amp; Company Value # Basically, the company value divided by the number of stocks equals the base share price. The rules state that a maximum of 10% deviation from this base price is possible.\nFor the three scenarios mentioned above, this can be summarized as follows:\nA: With 125,000 shares at 12.5 million AS$ company value, the base price is 100 AS$ and the maximum is 110 AS$. B and C: With 125,000 shares at 15 million AS$ company value, the base price is 120 AS$ and the maximum is 132 AS$. Stock prices are recalculated / adjusted on a daily basis, sticking closely to the actual book value. The better the company performs (in terms of cash flow), the quicker the shares rise. A dividend payout is basically a balance sheet contraction, extracting equity, thus leading to stock price depreciations.\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/en/docs/user-interface/management-tab/","title":"Management Tab","section":"User Interface","content":" Management Tab # The Management tab grants access to the Procurement, Human Resources, Investments and Finance menus.\nProcurement # Aircraft Manufacturers # On this page, you can see all the available aircraft types grouped by manufacturer and category (props, regional jets, narrow- and wide-bodies). Clicking on an aircraft model gives you a summary of its related variants and some general information like their capacities, speed and range.\nSelecting one of the variants opens the aircraft fact sheet with all of the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s relevant data (list price, production period and rate, route restrictions, payload, range, noise and maintenance category, performance etc.). It also allows you to check leasing / purchase options and review used aircraft offers (if applicable).\nAircraft Market # If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to buy or sell used aircraft, the Aircraft Market is the right place to go. The available aircraft can be filtered by financing type (cash, credit or leasing), offer type (auction or immediate purchase) as well as aircraft family and type.\nEach offer provides important information like the plane\u0026rsquo;s owner, its age and condition as well as the available payment options. If you want to get an overview of your existing bids and offers, switch to the Your Bids and Your Offers tabs on the top of the page.\nHuman Resources # Personnel Management # With the help of this menu, you can review and manage your employed staff. The page groups employees by their position (flight, cabin and ground crew) and provides insights into their employment status, mood and payroll details.\nExcept for pilots, all employees are hired automatically when needed. However, you\u0026rsquo;re able to change their salaries by typing the desired amount into the text field of the Next Week\u0026rsquo;s Salary column. Be careful: The wages you pay affect your staff\u0026rsquo;s friendliness and customer orientation and, ultimately, your company\u0026rsquo;s image.\nIf you need to dismiss employees, enter the number of staff members into the text field of the Redundant Personnel column.\nImportant\nCanceling work contracts requires you to make a redundancy payment equal to several weeks of default salary. Crew Management # This page lets you manage your pilots. On the left, you see a list of the currently employed and required pilots for each aircraft category (props, regional jets, narrow and wide-bodies). The green number displays the amount of reserve pilots; the red value shows how many pilots you still need. Aircraft which are ordered and not yet delivered are not part of this list.\nThe aircraft categories indicate which type of plane a pilot is allowed to operate. If you want to find the right pilot for a specific model, use the menu on the right to hire unemployed pilots or train new ones. Keep in mind that training a pilot will cost 5 to 8 times their weekly salary (depending on the aircraft category).\nIf you have non-working pilots, you can re-train them to operate another aircraft type by using the menu on the bottom right. The costs for re-training are much lower than training new pilots as existing staff usually have some general flying experience.\nInvestments # Markets \u0026amp; Exchanges # The Markets \u0026amp; Exchanges section depicts the development of the AirlineSim Global Economic Index (AGEX) and the game\u0026rsquo;s fuel prices.\nThe rest of the page shows the different stock exchanges and indices. Remember that the content of this page may vary depending on whether your game world supports Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) or not.\nSubsidiaries \u0026amp; Portfolio # If you acquired shares in other companies, this page will list them together with some general information such as ratings and book values.\nOrder List # Here, you can find a summary of your buying and selling orders regarding stock as well as your subscribed IPOs.\nFinance # Corporate Finance # This menu provides information on your company\u0026rsquo;s equity and debt. The Equity tab shows details on shareholders and IPOs (if applicable) while the Debt page displays existing loan contracts as well as information on new loans.\nAccounting # The accounting sheet is divided into three tabs: The Income Statement, the Balance Sheet and the Bank Account.\nThe Income Statement lists all revenues and expenses of your company as well as the final earnings. To provide more insight into your current financial situation, it structures the data into the following accounting measures:\nEBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In AirlineSim, this includes all expenses from your regular operations, while mostly imputed costs like depreciation of flight equipment or purely financial figures like the cost of capital are not. There is also an Adjusted EBITDA which excludes irregular expenses.\nEBIT: Earnings before interest and taxes. This is also called the Operative Result because it takes the depreciation of the equipment required to run your operations (like buildings and aircraft) into account and gives you an idea of how well the company did after subtracting all operative costs from the revenue.\nEBT: Last but not least, these are the earnings before taxes. Since there are no taxes in AirlineSim (yet), this can be seen as the final result. It differs from the EBIT in that it also adds or subtracts the costs of capital (like interest) or earnings from asset deals (like stock trades). Therefore, it is also called the Financial Result.\nThe Balance Sheet displays two tables: At the top, you get a profit and loss statement which is divided into an Expenses and an Earnings section. Both show the respective accounts (e.g. aircraft handling fees or leasing revenue) and their associated balance values. Underneath, you can see your company\u0026rsquo;s Assets (such as buildings or flight equipment) and Liabilities (like equity or loans).\nThe Bank Account tab lists your earnings and expenses along with their date, time and value.\nCash Flow # On this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find an overview of your company\u0026rsquo;s financial schedule which shows all earnings and expenses related to contracts, such as\nleasing payments, payments for private handling services, loan payments, staff salary (week-end closure) and dividends (if there was a successful IPO). The list also provides the next date and time for a payment. If it continues in the next period, only the first payment will be displayed. Earnings and expenses related to flights and maintenance won\u0026rsquo;t be included here since they will be paid once the services are done and don\u0026rsquo;t have a fixed amount or time associated with them.\nAsset Management # The Asset Management page is split into two parts: An Aircraft Assets tab which shows your acquired aircraft and allows you to sell or lease them (by clicking on the green book icon next to a model) and an Aircraft Transfer tab which lets you transfer aircraft from your current enterprise to any other subsidiary of your holding.\nLeasing # In the Leasing section, you get an overview of your leased aircraft along with their age, lessor, billing dates and leasing rates. You also have the option to cancel each of the leasing contracts. By switching to the second tab, you can view the aircraft that you have leased out.\n"},{"id":30,"href":"/en/docs/about/payment/","title":"Payment System","section":"About AirlineSim","content":" Payment System # AirlineSim utilizes a payment model that is geared towards fairness, transparency and ease-of-use.\nThis article covers everything you need to know about credits, credit consumption, prices, payment methods and the game\u0026rsquo;s premium features. If you have any questions regarding the payment process, please refer to our Payment FAQ.\nMotivation # AirlineSim is a very niche game (= comparatively few active players). It is also intended to be a serious business simulation, and its servers run elaborate simulation models that are very resource-intensive (= high operational costs).\nWith this in mind, there are certain requirements our payment model needs to meet:\nIt has to cover fairly high costs per active player. It has to be flexible enough to account for different usage intensities, like different amounts of active holdings per player or long-running game worlds. It must not provide any in-game advantages for real-world money besides an initial \u0026ldquo;anti-cheat unlock\u0026rdquo; through a single purchase (details below). It has to generate enough revenue despite a relatively small playerbase. It still needs to allow for perpetually free game play for players who are unable or do not want to spend money. It has to be as fair as possible to players because that is just something we care about. These requirements rule out most common payment models:\nA single purchase would not cover ongoing server costs. A mandatory recurring subscription tricks players into paying even after they have stopped using the game, is not very flexible and causes higher technical and administration complexity. And ad-supported model is just \u0026ldquo;meh\u0026rdquo; and likely would not generate enough revenue to cover our expenses due to low player numbers. Most free-2-play models are out because they either require pay-2-win mechanisms which are a no-go for a serious simulation like AirlineSim and/or rely on exploiting a handful of players for pointless cosmetics, something that is neither fair nor feasible given AirlineSim\u0026rsquo;s size. Consequently, we implemented a system based on credits that has served us very well over the years.\nCredits: Our Payment Model in a Nutshell # Our payment model revolves around so-called credits. After signing up for AirlineSim, your account starts out with a balance of 60 free credits.\nIn most game worlds, you are charged a small amount of credits for every holding you create. This amount varies depending on the duration of the game world. But given the initial amount of free credits and the typical cost of a short-term game world of 4 credits/day, you could try such a game world free of charge for as long as 15 days.\nOnce the credits run out, you need to recharge your account to continue playing. As such, the credit system is a prepaid model and thus completely flexible. Buying credits does not constitute a recurring subscription. You can buy credits whenever you like. If you ever decide to stop playing the game, all you have to do is let your credits run out.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s almost it! There\u0026rsquo;s one caveat: There is a difference between free accounts, meaning such that have never completed a payment, and premium accounts, meaning such that have at some point completed at least one payment. But we will touch on that below.\nCredit Consumption \u0026amp; Running out of Credits # Once you create a holding, credits are deducted from your account on a daily basis. In game worlds where you can create more than one holding, discounts apply to every additional holding.\nCurrently, the typical costs are as follows:\nshort-term worlds: 4 credits/day (2 per additional holding) medium-term worlds: 5 credits/day (3 per additional holding) long-term worlds: 6 credits/day (4 per additional holding) If you run out of credits, your account\u0026rsquo;s holdings and companies will be locked until you top up your balance. Credits will still be subtracted at the normal daily rate during this period, meaning your balance will become increasingly negative. The intention here is to prevent companies from gaining an unfair advantage by abandoning accounts and returning to them several weeks later, having avoided paying for their growth and the in-game resources they occupied in the meantime.\nExample\nIf an account owns one holding in a short-term game world and runs out of credits, it will have a balance of -20 credits after 5 days. These must be paid before access to the game is restored. If an account\u0026rsquo;s credits balance stays negative for more than 28 days, all holdings and airlines of that account will be deleted in all game worlds in order to free blocked in-game resources like slots and aircraft that would otherwise remain inaccessible to other players. The AirlineSim account itself will remain active and its credit balance will be automatically topped up to the initial 60 credits, effectively resetting your account to its initial state. If it had premium status before, it will keep it beyond the reset.\nPlease keep in mind that the grace period of 28 days applies to premium accounts which have previously purchased credits. For trial accounts, it takes 7 days after running out of credits until the airlines are deleted.\nDanger!\nNote that automatic deletions due to a negative credit balance affect all game worlds an account has holdings in, including free ones! Playing for Free: Free vs. Premium Accounts # AirlineSim offers free short-term game worlds, meaning no credits are charged to play there. As such, you could play AirlineSim without paying a cent indefinitely.\nBut there are some limitations: Unless you have completed at least one payment, your account remains in a free or trial state. This means that some features of the game are unavailable to you even when playing in free game worlds.\nThe majority of those features imply direct interaction between multiple accounts and the requirement to complete at least one payment is a very effective anti-cheat mechanism. Features in this category are:\nCreating more than one holding Multiple airlines in one holding Offering or accepting private contracts (for example for leasing out aircraft or interlining) Selling aircraft Bidding on non-official aircraft offers Layoffs (as fired staff ends up in a pool available to other players) Stock exchange functions (Initial Public Offerings and share trading) Player-owned buildings There are a couple features that are restricted for mostly historic reasons. Back when current-generation AirlineSim launched - around 2007 - these features caused higher load on our servers and hence were restricted to premium accounts:\nThe Online Reservation System (ORS) Integrated flight operations control These restrictions will likely fall once those features are modernized.\nPricing # AirlineSim offers a tiered pricing model with different package sizes, which allows you to choose the right amount of credits for every situation: Buy a small one if you just want to dip your toe into the water or get premium status cheaply. Buy larger ones if you intend to play for a longer time, benefiting from bulk discounts.\nAt the time of writing this, the smallest package at 50 Credits costs 2.49 EUR. So at this tier, a simple account with a daily consumption of 4 credits would cost around 6 EUR per month. At a much more common 500 Credits for 19.10 EUR, that price is already down to around 4.60 EUR.\nYou can find a full, up-to-date list of all prices and the respective bulk discounts on the account management page.\nPayment Methods \u0026amp; Checkout # In order to buy credits for AirlineSim, simply log into your account and click on Buy Credits. Here you can choose your desired package size, optionally enter a voucher code (currently only outside of Steam) and select your payment method.\nInfo\nCurrently, the following payment methods can be used during checkout: Credit or Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), PayPal, paysafecard, Online Bank Transfer and Prepayment. If playing through Steam, all payment methods offered by Steam are available. Please note: Which payment methods are actually available might depend on both the country you are paying from and the selected package size.\nOnce your payment has been processed, the credits will be added to your account.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/en/docs/faqs/steam/","title":"Steam Release","section":"FAQs","content":" Steam Release # In this article, we\u0026rsquo;re covering everything you need to know about AirlineSim’s release on Steam.

Over the years, the game has seen a lot of progress, both in terms of in-game improvements and a steadily growing community.\nWhile the game is technically fully playable, we decided to launch AirlineSim in Early Access in order to enhance the game’s user experience, ensuring a smooth integration into the new platform. Once we feel like AirlineSim offers a natural experience close to that of a regular desktop MMOG, we will leave Early Access.\nIn addition, we want to make use of the time in Early Access by working on several other improvements to the game that are not just specific to Steam and will be of use to both new and existing players alike.\nWhat does the Steam release mean for me and my game? # The release on Steam does not mean you’ll have to use a Steam account. You can and will always be able to access and play AirlineSim the way you always do, and of course all of your airlines and companies will remain unaffected.\nAs mentioned above, we’re exploring Steam as a new way to reach potential players, so while you will have the option to access the game through Steam, the only changes that you’ll see in the future will be the in-game improvements that we plan to implement as part of the game’s Early Access journey.\nWill I need a Steam account to play AirlineSim in the future? # No, the release does not mean that you’ll have to create a Steam account. If you don’t want to play AirlineSim using Steam, you’ll always have the option to login to your AirlineSim account and play as you normally would.\nWhat is wishlisting about and why is it so important? # If you have an account on Steam, you can wishlist the game by visiting the AirlineSim store page and clicking on the \u0026ldquo;add to your wishlist\u0026rdquo; button located below the section showing the game trailer and images at the top of the page.\nThe wishlisting feature allows you to keep track of the game and it helps us out a lot, too, as it can impact AirlineSim’s visibility on Steam.\nHow can I support the Steam release beyond wishlisting? # As the game has been released on Steam, it would be extremely helpful for us if you would leave a positive review for the game! The Steam rating is the single most important thing that decides over whether a game will be successful on this platform!\nTo do so, follow these steps:\nInstall AirlineSim through Steam. Once the game has opened, do not create a new account but instead connect your existing one by logging in with your usual AirlineSim credentials. After having spent some time in the Steam version of AirlineSim - the more the better - go to the store page and leave a review. Will the game’s payment system change as part of the Steam release? # No, the payment system will remain the same, even on Steam. The game will be listed as free to play with the option of purchasing credits in-game. While running the game through Steam, payments must be made using your Steam Wallet. Outside of Steam, all current non-Steam payment methods will be available as usual.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/en/docs/advanced/finances/bankruptcy-and-loans/","title":"Bankruptcy and Loans","section":"Finances","content":" Bankruptcy and Loans # Inability to Pay # Inability to pay or insolvency means that a natural person or legal entity isn\u0026rsquo;t able to pay for bills through their own cash flow, meaning the regular income isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient to cover the regular costs. In most cases, the credit limit is used up as well. This often results in giving up the company and ceasing commercial operations.\nInfo\nIn AirlineSim, there is no overdraft credit to pay leasing installments or salaries from, so your company\u0026rsquo;s liquidity is determined by the balance of your bank account. If you\u0026rsquo;re unable to pay the leasing rate of an aircraft, your enterprise is considered unable to pay at that specific moment. In that case, the leasing contract will be immediately terminated, the aircraft returned and the security deposit (minus the leasing rate) refunded to your bank account.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t pay the salaries of your employees during week-end closing, consequences are more serious as your enterprise will be liquidated.\nSo, without enough observation, even a healthy enterprise can run into financial difficulties. It\u0026rsquo;s important to calculate accurately and build some cash reserves as long as your enterprise is making profit. A timetable can help monitoring fixed costs (leasing rates, ground handling), loans, salaries and predicted dividend payout.\nCompany Liquidation # If an enterprise is liquidated due to inability to pay at the time of week-end closing or if the enterprise is given up in the meantime, it\u0026rsquo;ll be dissolved as follows:\nAircraft are returned to the lessor (security deposit is refunded minus the leasing costs) or marketed (at 15% of its book value). Employees are laid off (salaries plus compensation are paid). Loans are paid off (interests are calculated pro rata). Buildings are demolished (for a fee). The liquidation process is completed by paying out the leftover amount to the superordinate enterprise.\nCredit System # In AirlineSim, loans are managed and paid out by the AS-Bank. The creditworthiness and therefore maximal sum of loans you\u0026rsquo;re offered as well as the corresponding interest are influenced by different factors:\nThe rating of your enterprise, the amount of equity, the amount of already signed loans and the amount of profit. In intervals of seven days after signing the loan contract, the loan and interest have to be paid in rates. You can opt to dissolve the loan contract at any time if the balance of your bank account allows you to immediately settle the loan (plus an additional fee).\nThe game offers loans with and without securities.\nLoans Without Securities # Loans without securities allow you to raise your liquidity. If you sign a loan contract in the New Loan menu (by going to the Management tab and selecting Debt in the Corporate Finance section), you\u0026rsquo;ll get a loan without securities. This type of loan isn\u0026rsquo;t bound to any investments you plan, so the interest is a bit higher compared to a loan with securities. The specific interest for a loan without security depends on the current prime rate, but can be higher depending on your creditworthiness.\nLoans with Securities # Loans with securities are only offered when buying new aircraft, so they\u0026rsquo;re always bound to a specific investment and won\u0026rsquo;t raise the liquidity of your enterprise. Therefore, they are somewhat equal to a financed purchase. The specific object you invested in is used to safeguard your loan and will be passed into the AS-Bank\u0026rsquo;s ownership in case of illiquidity. Given that, the AS-Bank is willing to offer higher loans and lower interests compared to a loan without securities.\nRatings # Ratings play an important role when it comes to finances in AirlineSim. Your creditworthiness is represented by rating steps, with AAA being the best rating and D the worst:\nAAA - AA - A - BBB - BB - B - CCC - CC - C - CI - D\nYou can review your airline\u0026rsquo;s ratings on your company\u0026rsquo;s overview page / dashboard.\nImpact of Ratings # The game evaluates each enterprise in matters of creditworthiness. The resulting rating is published (making it visible to every user) and updated after each transaction that may affect your creditworthiness.\nYour rating (i.e. creditworthiness) influences three important parts of the game.\nFinanced purchases from AirlineSim: If you want to lease an aircraft from an AS enterprise or purchase an aircraft financed by the AS-Bank, your rating must be at least B or better. Sometimes, even a rating of BB isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient. However, if an aircraft is leased from another lessor (i.e. another user), your rating doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, so you could lease a plane even with a CCC rating.\nInterest and loans: The lower your rating, the lower the maximal sum of loans you\u0026rsquo;re offered and the more the interest differs from the prime rate. Most of the time, the AS-Bank won\u0026rsquo;t offer any new loans when your rating is CCC or lower. Depending on the debt-to-equity ratio, you\u0026rsquo;re usually not even offered new loans with a B rating.\nIPOs (Initial Public Offerings): An IPO isn\u0026rsquo;t possible if your rating is BBB or lower. Remember that potential investors will take a look at your rating, so an IPO with a minimum rating of A or marginally better might frighten them off. The better your rating, the better your impression.\nEvaluated Parameters # Ratings are calculated from several financial parameters of the evaluated enterprise, such as the equity-to-debt ratio (your loans) and predicted cash flow. The exact formula is confidential, but here is an overview of some of the evaluated factors.\nCash Flow: This describes the net gain in a fixed period. In AirlineSim, this is simplified as the profit from your Profit and Loss Statement, minus write-offs (you can find the statement by going to the Management tab, selecting Accounting and navigating to the Balance Sheet).\nCash Reserve: This is the amount of freely available capital on your bank account.\nEquity-to-Fixed-Assets Ratio: The refers to the ratio between your assets (i.e. your flight equipment account, security deposits and optional buildings) and net equity. In theory, there are three ratios, but the game uses the first one. It\u0026rsquo;s evaluated as follows: Equity-to-Fixed-Assets Ratio = Equity / Assets x 100.\nEquity Ratio: This represents the amount of your own cash (including that of your shareholders) in your enterprise. Loans are considered debt capital. Example: If a company\u0026rsquo;s balance sheet shows a total asset amount of 100 million AS$ and loans of 35.5 million AS$, it has an Equity Ratio of 64.5%.\nReturn on Equity (ROE): This value refers to the yield of the used capital in a specific timeframe and describes how much money an airline gains from the available net equity. The ratio is calculated as follows: Return on Equity = Profit / Net Equity x 100.\nCash Ratio: This parameter describes the short-term ability to meet financial obligations, calculated as follows: Cash Ratio = Liquid Assets (the cash on your bank account) / Short-Term Debts (all regular payments like salaries, leasing rates etc.)\nCurrent Ratio: Same as the Cash Ratio, but in this case, current assets (liquid assets plus security deposits) are considered liquid assets as well.\nProfit Margin: This is the percentage of profit from your earnings (per week in AirlineSim). It\u0026rsquo;s calculated as follows: Profit Margin = Profit / Earnings x 100\nDebt Ratio: The Debt Ratio is the part of loans compared to your total assets, so it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat the opposite of your profit margin. It\u0026rsquo;s calculated as follows: Debt Ratio = Loans / Equity x 100\nPrime Rates # In reality, the responsible central banking authority defines prime rates in given intervals. In AirlineSim, prime rates aren\u0026rsquo;t written in stone. They are adjusted to the current development of a game world and may change several times a day. Therefore, they can perish larger and more frequent up- and downturns compared to reality.\nOn the front page of every game world, two prime rates are shown: One for loans without securities and another for loans with securities. Keep in mind that the prime rates stated here require you to have an AAA rating - if your rating is lower, the AS-Bank may ask for higher interest.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/en/docs/beginners-guide/creating-routes/","title":"Creating Routes","section":"Beginner's Guide","content":" Creating Routes # You\u0026rsquo;ve successfully acquired your first aircraft, so let\u0026rsquo;s start planning your airline\u0026rsquo;s routes! After the previous steps, you might already have a rough idea of where you want to fly, but now we\u0026rsquo;ll have a look at the details.\nFinding Airport Information # If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in a specific airport, you can search for it by typing its name or IATA code into the bar at the top of the screen. The airport\u0026rsquo;s page offers lots of details, but for now, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the Information tab.\nHere, you can find data such as the airport\u0026rsquo;s runway length, size, slots (the amount of flights that can take place per 5 minute window), minimum transfer time, nighttime bans, noise restrictions and demand.\nAs the demand affects your connections, let\u0026rsquo;s see how you can take it into account during the route creation process!\nConsidering Demand # An airport\u0026rsquo;s demand is displayed by two green bars: One indicating passenger demand, the other representing cargo demand. Naturally, more passengers will fly between two major cities than between two smaller ones, so keep the demand levels in mind when planning your routes.\nDomestic Demand # You will always find passengers wanting to fly to the capital of their country, which is why it\u0026rsquo;s advised to select a capital city as your hub and connect your domestic routes with your international flights.\nA good domestic network has several advantages: It provides you with transfer passengers for your international routes and it makes you an attractive interlining partner. Additionally, it can be quite profitable in some countries as the domestic market is more protected.\nReal Life Demand # In many cases, real life demand is reflected in the game: Old ties still exist between Spain and Latin America or the UK and India or Australia. Austria had many connections with former communist countries and the small Canary Islands attract thousands of tourists.\nWhen comparing different routes, you can use this to your advantage! Check out sites like FlightStats to get information on real flights.\nChecking Existing In-Game Routes # Apart from the demand, it can be useful to have a look at the existing in-game routes, especially when you join a game world that has been running for a while. If several companies offer multiple flights between two airports, there is a good chance that you can squeeze in an extra flight.\nTurning Your Hub Into a Hub # We already discussed the advantages of having a good domestic network, but here\u0026rsquo;s some general advice on creating connections to and from your hub.\nFirst off, try to set up routes in different directions as passengers will travel to your hub and take connecting flights. Check out the airport\u0026rsquo;s minimum transfer time to make sure that passengers can actually catch them, but keep in mind that they won\u0026rsquo;t wait more than 8 hours for a transfer flight either.\nIf your flights arrive and depart in waves, you can create countless possible connections. No matter how small your base country is, you can build an excellent international network!\nExtending the Range # When deciding on routes, it can help to check the range of your aircraft. Each plane can fly a certain distance with a full load. It can fly further, but then it\u0026rsquo;ll carry more fuel and less passengers. If you want to extend the range, equip your plane with better seats. This will get you a higher rating on the Online Reservation System (ORS) and you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to fly a full load (i.e. less passengers at a higher ticket price).\nUsing Your Geographical Position # Last but not least, think about how your geographical position influences your choice of routes. While it can be a limiting factor, it also gives you advantages: If you are based in the Middle East, for example, your routes can connect Europe and Asia. An airline in Mexico can reach most parts of the US and half of South America with medium sized jets like the 737. Africa doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that many major airports, but several African countries have signed the Yamoussoukro agreement which makes via-flights interesting (see Traffic Rights).\nOpening Stations # With all of these factors in mind, you can determine your airline\u0026rsquo;s routes. Once you\u0026rsquo;re happy with them, let\u0026rsquo;s set them up in the game by opening stations at your desired airports!\nYour first station is already open at the location where your enterprise is based. To open a new station, simply navigate to an airport\u0026rsquo;s page and click on the Open Station button. You can also look up a country to see its list of airports and set up a station from there.\nAnother option is to click on the Operations tab and select Stations. In the Open New Station panel on the right side, you can enter the station\u0026rsquo;s exact name or IATA code and hit Open Station. Please note that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to build a terminal at an airport to handle passengers - it is assumed that public facilities already exist.\nOpening or closing a station doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost anything as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not actively being used.\nHowever, there are staffing costs involved in handling passengers once you start scheduling flights to the airport, with the employees in question being hired automatically based on the number of passengers you expect to handle at the station.\nStation Managers: Currently not in use, won\u0026rsquo;t be hired. Check-In Agents: Take care of passenger handling. Will not be needed or hired if the airport is only used for cargo. Ramp Agents: Coordinate the handling of the actual aircraft on the ground. Cargo Controllers: Take care of the cargo handling. Will not be needed or hired if the airport does not handle cargo. If you reduce the handled amount of passengers or cargo to the point where staffing demands are reduced, personnel will become available for other stations.\nAvailable employees can either be fired (although you\u0026rsquo;ll have to pay them a settlement) or used to open up other stations in case they require additional personnel later on. This is done automatically: Idle staff will be moved wherever it\u0026rsquo;s needed before new people are hired.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/en/docs/user-interface/database-tab/","title":"Database Tab","section":"User Interface","content":" Database Tab # The database tab lets you access important game resources like different directories, the Online Reservation System (ORS) and the game rules.\nDirectories # Countries # This section provides a list of all available countries in the game.

Some crew members will already be added by default, but let\u0026rsquo;s find out how to employ pilots manually.\nFirst, select the Management tab and go to Crew Management. On the left, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of the employed and required pilots, grouped together by aircraft category. As pilots can\u0026rsquo;t work the whole day, the number of required pilots is higher than actually necessary for a flight. For example, if your plane flies 20 hours per day, you need three crews to operate it and a fourth crew to replace pilots on sick leave or holiday.\nThe green number towards the right displays the amount of reserve pilots whereas the red value shows how many pilots still need to be added. Keep in mind that, with the exception of some models, an aircraft typically requires a pilot and copilot.\nThe listed aircraft categories are divided into props, regional jets, narrow- and wide-body machines. They indicate which type of plane a pilot is allowed to operate and can also be found on the Aircraft Manufacturers page.\nIn order to find the right pilot for your aircraft type, have a look at the menu on the right: Here, you can hire unemployed pilots from the job market or train new ones. Both options will provide you with pilots immediately. However, training a pilot will cost 5 to 8 times the weekly salary depending on the aircraft category.\nIf you have employed but non-working pilots available due to an aircraft sale or the end of a lease, you can also choose to re-train them to operate another type of aircraft. The costs for re-training are significantly lower than training new pilots as it is assumed that existing staff have general flying experience.\nManaging Staff # In case you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a general overview of your employees, click on Personnel Management in the Management tab. Here you\u0026rsquo;ll see the number of staff members, their employment status, mood and payroll details.\nThe list groups employees by their position: Pilots, cabin crew, administrative personnel and so on. Personnel other than pilots are hired by the system automatically if they are required; however, you can control their wages by typing the desired value into the salary field and pressing Adjust.\nBear in mind that the automated system only hires necessary personnel - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fire them if you don\u0026rsquo;t need them anymore. In order to discharge crew members, enter the desired number of employees into the field in the Redundant Personnel column and select Lay-Off.\nImportant\nFiring personnel isn\u0026rsquo;t free - you will have to make a one-off redundancy payment equal to several weeks of default salary, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth thinking about whether your reasons for dismissing staff involve short or long periods of time.

It didn\u0026rsquo;t cost them much, but passengers appreciated the service.\nOur virtual passengers like to be pampered, too! Fortunately, good on-board service - drinks, meals, newspapers and so on - isn\u0026rsquo;t that expensive and the higher rating is definitely worth the price.\nBusiness and first class passengers are harder to please, but if you offer first class seats, then why not offer first class service? It\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to install big seats and sell cheap tickets because the passengers dislike your service.\nOf course service profiles aren\u0026rsquo;t mandatory. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve equipped your aircraft with seats, flight attendants and pilots, it\u0026rsquo;s ready for take-off, so you\u0026rsquo;re free to cut the on-board service and roll the savings into lower ticket prices. However, good on-board service will make flights at a particular price point more attractive for customers.\nCreating \u0026amp; Assigning Service Profiles # If you want to set up service profiles, navigate to the Commercial tab and select Service Profiles. You can create a new one by entering a name on the right and clicking on Create Profile.\nOn the following page, you can define which on-board service you want to offer in each class (Business, Economy, First). The available options are divided into a food section, which includes drinks, snacks, a main course and a second meal, and a non-food section, which lets you determine the available headphones, meal packaging, newspapers and magazines.\nEach service option can be viewed together with its associated costs. You\u0026rsquo;ll also get an overview of how your choices influence the customers\u0026rsquo; ratings.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no recipe regarding the best and most economical settings. The choice of on-board service depends on your airline concept: If you\u0026rsquo;re planning on running a low-cost carrier, your passengers probably won\u0026rsquo;t be sleeping on a bed of roses, so keep your business plan in mind when setting up service profiles.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re finished, you can go back to the overview and make one of the available service profiles your default. This will automatically apply it to any new flights you create, assuming that no distance restrictions apply to them.\nInfo\nSome meals require flights to have a range of at least 800 or 1,500 km, so if your default service profile includes any of these, it will not be applied to shorter flights and the game will leave them blank instead. Therefore, it may be necessary to create different service profiles for short-haul and long-haul flights. You can also assign service profiles manually once you start creating flight numbers or by visiting the Inventory page in the Commercial tab.\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/en/docs/beginners-guide/cabin-configuration/","title":"Configuring the Cabins","section":"Beginner's Guide","content":" Configuring the Cabins # Before you can hit the skies, you need to equip your aircraft with a cabin and configure its seat layout - regardless of whether you own new or used machines. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it\u0026rsquo;s done!\nInfo\nThis step does not apply if you want to operate cargo aircraft. Though it\u0026rsquo;s not the best, there is a default configuration already installed in all of your new aircraft. Using the Cabin Editor # Go to the Commercial tab and select Cabin Configurations. This page shows all of your existing setups. In order to create a new one, pick a name, choose which aircraft type it should apply to and click on Create New Configuration.\nThe cabin editor shows information regarding the plane type, its passenger capacity and the configuration status. Next to that, you\u0026rsquo;ll find the Save Configuration button. Never forget to save your configuration or you will have to start all over again!\nOn the left side of the editor, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the empty deck of your plane. First off, select a class (Economy, Business or First) and add it by clicking on Choose One. You can equip your aircraft with any class you prefer, but keep in mind that a three-class setup is usually applied to large aircraft. If an aircraft has two decks, you can configure both decks separately (main deck and upper deck).\nOnce the classes are set up, you can equip each one with seats and deploy additional flight attendants:\nSeat types: By clicking on Select next to Seat, you can decide which type of seat you want to put in each class. Better seats result in higher ratings, however they\u0026rsquo;re usually pricey and take up more space, decreasing the maximum number of passengers you can transport. It\u0026rsquo;s always a trade-off between quality and efficiency: If you\u0026rsquo;re the only airline on a route, you can aim to offer as many seats as possible; if a route has many competitors, it\u0026rsquo;s preferable to offer more comfortable seats.\nNumber of seats: You can select the number of seats under Seats/Cabin. If you choose 0, the class won\u0026rsquo;t be used in the cabin configuration. If you already added seats to other classes, you can use the Top Up button to fill up the remaining space with seats for the class that you\u0026rsquo;re currently editing.\nExtra pitch: If you want to give your passengers more leg room, don’t remove seat rows - just increase the extra pitch value and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go!\nAdditional F / As: Here, you can add additional flight attendants for each class. You should already have a base number of staff but you can assign more employees to increase ratings. Tip: Aircraft with fewer than 20 seats don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need a flight attendant. By default, one attendant is responsible for 50 passengers per class. More flight attendants have a positive effect on the evaluation of your flights.\nIf you’re unsure how your current configuration affects your passengers ratings, just save it and switch to the Ratings tab. And remember: Each aircraft type requires its own cabin layout!\nTips for Your Configuration # Here\u0026rsquo;s some general advice to help you with the cabin configuration process:\nOne flight attendant per class: Every class needs at least one flight attendant. Even if you only install two first class seats, you still have to assign a flight attendant to your first class. Keep in mind that your staff works 8 hour shifts, so if you\u0026rsquo;re flying for 20 hours a day, one flight attendant equals multiple employees on your payroll.\nAdditional flight attendants: The number of additional flight attendants is up to you, but passengers appreciate the attention. A higher rating may be worth the extra salaries.\nEconomy vs. Business: As the business class usually has bigger seats, better service and less passengers per flight attendant, two economy passengers may be more profitable than one business class customer. Just remember to take the costs into account when setting up your cabin.\nFirst Class: If you find it difficult to fill the first class on some routes, you can try offering it only on long-haul routes of 2,000 km and above or even leaving it out entirely in some planes.\nCheck your configuration: After creating a cabin, double check it. Once we assign it to the aircraft in the next step, you can\u0026rsquo;t even add a flight attendant without completely refurbishing your plane.\nChanging cabins: If you change the cabin configuration of an aircraft, the new setup will be used after 3 days.\nWhat do passengers expect? # It all depends on your route and marketing strategy: If you want to run a low-cost airline, stuff your planes with narrow seats and sell cheaper tickets. If you\u0026rsquo;re establishing more of an average airline, equip your planes with slightly better seats. Most planes have 80% economy and 20% business class seats, but of course you\u0026rsquo;re free to distribute seats as you prefer.\nOn short-haul routes, passengers should be okay with basic seating. On medium-haul flights, you could equip some classes with more advanced seats. If passengers are scarce and competition is hard, you can try using better seats for economy passengers.\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/en/docs/user-interface/private-messages/","title":"Private Messages","section":"User Interface","content":" Private Messages # This tab grants you access to the in-game messages you have sent and received.\nMessages are sorted into different mail boxes that each consist of an inbox and an outbox.

Not just yet, you still need a maintenance provider! Without repairs, your aircraft won\u0026rsquo;t be flying for very long…\nIn the Operations tab, select Maintenance and choose a maintenance company servicing your aircraft. There are several options with certain advantages and disadvantages. Every provider has different values regarding price, quality and the duration of maintenance.\nPrice: This represents the relative cost of performing the same amount of maintenance on an aircraft. Quality: This indicates the maintenance standard. Be careful: A low-quality provider may never get your aircraft to 100% condition. Efficiency: This stands for the amount of maintenance that is achieved in a specific time span. A very efficient provider will get more work done in less time compared to an inefficient one; still, it may not be worth the price, especially if your aircraft spends a long time on the ground. Important\nOnce you have selected a maintenance company, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to change it for two weeks. When thinking about maintenance, try to avoid looking at the price first. Instead, choose a provider that suits your planned operations.\nYou can also select a maintenance provider later, but if you\u0026rsquo;re going to prepare flight plans soon, it\u0026rsquo;s probably best to pick one now. Changing providers afterwards will affect the amount of time your aircraft can spend in the air and determine how long they have to stay on the ground per day, so you may have to change your flight plans accordingly.\nAdditional Tips # Here is some advice on maintenance and its integration into your flight schedule (which we\u0026rsquo;ll cover soon).\nMinimum flight plan gap: If you want maintenance to take place between your flights, your flight schedule needs to leave a minimum gap of 120 minutes (incl. turnaround times). With a ground time of 119 minutes and below, no maintenance will be carried out.\nPrice, quality or efficiency? Symmetric flight schedules with daily maintenance windows allow you to go for a maintenance contractor that is efficient and cheap. However, asymmetric schedules may shift your focus from the price towards a contractor offering higher quality maintenance in order to slow down the deterioration of your aircrafts\u0026rsquo; condition.\nOwned planes: Owning aircraft allows your flight plans to be less tight. Instead of cramping the schedule, you can leave gaps for connecting flight waves. Going for a cheaper provider may be worth sacrificing quality and / or efficiency in some cases and reduce maintenance costs for every single flight. Seems odd? No! A real life example for this strategy is Allegiant Air.\nAircraft age: The age of your aircraft doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the amount of time required for maintenance, but does influence the costs. The older your plane, the more spare parts will be used during maintenance, as failures and wear take their toll.\n"},{"id":45,"href":"/en/docs/beginners-guide/scheduling-flights/","title":"Scheduling Flights","section":"Beginner's Guide","content":" Scheduling Flights # With the maintenance provider ready to go, it\u0026rsquo;s finally time to get your aircraft flying! This can be quite simple or a bit complicated, depending on where you are, what your airline is trying to achieve and how much competition you\u0026rsquo;re facing.\nThis tutorial will focus on getting a basic flight plan up and running, but a lot of the more advanced concepts should be pretty self-evident by the time you\u0026rsquo;re through with it.\nPlanning the Flight Schedule # Before we jump in, let\u0026rsquo;s think about how you want to set up your schedule by having a look at some of the involved parameters.\nStaying Profitable # If you\u0026rsquo;re leasing an aircraft, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to pay the weekly leasing rate plus the salaries for pilots and cabin crew - even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take off.\nIf your plane makes one return flight per day (from A to B and B to A), the leasing cost per flight equals the weekly leasing cost divided by 14. If your plane makes three return flights per day, the leasing cost per flight equals the weekly leasing cost divided by 42.\nSo in order to stay profitable, your plane has to fly as much as possible.\nMaintenance Ratios # In the Aircraft Info section of the flight planning page (to which we\u0026rsquo;ll get in a second), you\u0026rsquo;ll see your plane\u0026rsquo;s maintenance ratio. This value displays an aircraft\u0026rsquo;s ratio of maintenance to flight and can be seen as an indicator regarding its efficiency. Generally speaking, the higher the ratio, the less money you can earn with your plane.\nWhen it comes to flight plans and maintenance, there are a few things to consider: First off, maintenance is scheduled automatically. This is indicated by a light blue background in the schedule. It will occur at any airport as long as the plane is on the ground. However, in order to successfully perform maintenance, your schedule needs to have a gap of at least 2 hours between two flights.\nIf the aircraft has no scheduled flights, the maintenance ratio is at 100%. After planning the first return flight, you may notice that the maintenance ratio has a higher value, however this can be lowered back to 100% by scheduling more flights.\nImportant\nA maintenance ratio below 100% means that the schedule doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave enough time for the technicians to do repairs, which leads to a daily decrease of the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s condition. Once it drops below 50%, the plane will be grounded and is not allowed to operate flights until it has been repaired. Booked flights will be canceled and passengers refunded. In order to prevent that, make sure to include weekly maintenance windows (depending on your aircraft\u0026rsquo;s age, model and schedule). For short- and medium-haul schedules, you should allow daily maintenance. Customers appreciate a well maintained aircraft, so you\u0026rsquo;ll also get better ratings and more bookings.\nAs mentioned above, maintenance is carried out at every airport, not only at your hub. It can be practical to leave time for maintenance at your hub, though. That way, passengers have enough time to take a connecting flight (that is, if all of your planes arrive more or less at the same time and leave around two hours later). When your other waves arrive, only leave the planes on the ground for the minimum transfer time.\nMinimum Transfer Times \u0026amp; Turnarounds # Every airport that offers transfers has a minimum transfer time, which can be checked on the airport\u0026rsquo;s information page. This is the minimum time that passengers need in order to catch a connecting flight. Passengers leave the plane as soon as it lands, which is usually around half an hour before the plane is ready for its next flight.\nWhen you look at your flight schedule, you can see that it displays both flight and turnaround times. The turnaround consists of all the activities that take place after a plane has arrived and before it\u0026rsquo;s ready for departure again. The exact duration for a specific route can be viewed using the Performance Check Tool.\nInfo\nIncomplete turnarounds due to a lack of time between flights will lead to delays in your flight operations. It also can\u0026rsquo;t hurt to leave some extra buffer between flights so your operations become less prone to cascading delays caused by random disturbances affecting flight and ground operations. Putting the Puzzle Together # With the associated costs, maintenance ratios and transfer / turnaround times in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s lay out your flight schedule.\nUse the Performance Check Tool to view the flight times of your desired connections. Next, divide the flights between your planes in a way that the maintenance ratio of every plane is as close to 100% as possible. If the maintenance ratio is above 200%, your plane is wasting precious time on the ground.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the schedule, we can set it up in-game!\nCreating Your First Connection # First, select Fleet Management in the Operations tab and choose the fleet your aircraft is assigned to. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t change the fleet assignment, you\u0026rsquo;ll find the aircraft in the default fleet.\nEach aircraft is listed with three symbols: The little book on the left shows your aircraft\u0026rsquo;s contract details, the second icon takes you to scheduling and the third one displays the plane\u0026rsquo;s current flights.\nClicking on the scheduling symbol leads you to a page with your empty schedule. Here you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to create your first flight number.\nTo add a new flight:\nEnter a new flight number (without the airline code). Select a departure airport and time. Choose a price level and service profile (you can also leave it on default if you choose to manage prices and service through the Inventory section of the Commercial tab). Pick an arrival airport. Click on Create New Flight Number. Info\nIf the departure or arrival airport of your choice isn\u0026rsquo;t listed, make sure you open a station (branch office) at this airport. After creating a new flight number, the flight planning section will appear.\nFor each day of the week, it informs you whether your desired connection is possible or not. If not, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a red cross in which case you can try changing the departure time. For a flight to be scheduled, all fields must have green check marks.\nBy default, the flights will be scheduled for every day of the week (you can change that in the game settings). If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to operate on a daily basis (or can\u0026rsquo;t because of slot problems), you can select / deselect each day individually.\nOnce every check is green, click on Apply Schedule Settings to create the flight and assign it to your aircraft.\nScheduling the Return Flight # After saving your flight, you can click on it in the flight plan section to view details on the flight number. Here, you can edit your prices and on-board service, either for that particular flight or for the route as a whole.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll also notice that the schedule shows a series of alarmingly red boxes, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry - this is because we only planned one direction so far. Without a return flight, the aircraft will be stuck at the destination airport and might not be able to operate further flights.\nHowever, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to return to the same destination immediately and round trips (e.g. airport A to B to C to A) are possible as well.\nBy default, the scheduling form is now filled in with a new flight number, the airport pair for the return flight and a new time suggestion based on the previous flight. You can change these settings if you want to fly to another destination or at an earlier / later time.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the settings, you can schedule the return flight by clicking on Create New Flight Number.\nLike before, the flight planning menu appears. After making sure all fields have green check marks, you can apply the schedule settings.\nImportant\nAs mentioned previously, make sure to leave a sufficient time window between your flights. If your departure time is set before the time the airplane is ready, the flight turns red and the time window section displays red crosses. In that case, adjust your departure times to avoid overlapping flights. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully scheduled the return trip, your flights turn yellow. This indicates that the plan has been set up correctly and that there are no missing or broken flights.\nActivating the Schedule # Now that your first schedule is ready, it\u0026rsquo;s time to allow the Online Reservation System (ORS) to add passengers and freight to your flights.\nRemember those yellow flight plan boxes? That means you have successfully blocked the slots, but no one can book the connections yet. In order to get bookings, your flights need to be activated first!\nImportant\nWithout activation, the flights will be deleted after a few days to prevent slot blocking. You can activate your flight plan by navigating to the Select Flight Plan Operation menu below your schedule. You can choose between activating the flight plan right away or applying a three day delay.\nThe delay is useful to avoid mix-ups when changing existing flight schedules. Already booked flights of the old schedule will be completed before booking the new schedule in the ORS. It can also be helpful if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure whether your plane will be fully booked within one day.\nAfter deciding for an option, your scheduled flights turn green, which means that your flight plan has now been successfully activated!\nTransferring Aircraft # Your flights appear at least 30 minutes after activating your schedule. The first actual connection will take place no earlier than 24 hours after the system has received the flight plans. By clicking on the little icon on the far right of an aircraft\u0026rsquo;s entry on the Fleet Management page, you get a list of all the flights that can be booked for passengers or freight.\nTo operate these flights, your aircraft has to be at the first departure airport on the list. If your aircraft is located somewhere else, you need to add a transfer flight by using the Schedule Transfer Flight menu on the right side of the flight planning page.\nHere, you can select your desired airport. The aircraft will then be relocated to the new destination and the transfer flight appears on the list - there is no need to look for slots. After the transfer has been completed, it will disappear. Keep in mind that transfer flights are free of charge but need some time to be completed.\nInstead of booking a transfer, you can also cancel any out-of-place flights. There is no cancellation penalty as long as your flights are empty. If you cancel flights that already have bookings, however, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to refund the tickets.\nWaiting for the First Passengers # Good job! Now you\u0026rsquo;re ready for the first passengers to board your planes.\nYou can either keep scheduling flights for other aircraft or wait for your planes to fill. Each airport will book its ticket demands to the available routes once per day. The specific time can be found on the airport\u0026rsquo;s information page in the Demand Calculation section.\nThe tickets will be booked up to three days in advance, so you can only tell how many passengers / freight units were actually booked at the time of departure. When your aircraft takes off, all the revenues and expenses for the flight are added to your account. Maintenance will be paid once it\u0026rsquo;s done, while costs for staff, leasing contracts and loans will be deducted on a weekly basis.\n"},{"id":46,"href":"/en/docs/beginners-guide/congratulations/","title":"Congratulations!","section":"Beginner's Guide","content":" Congratulations! # The title says it all - you have successfully completed our beginner\u0026rsquo;s guide!
