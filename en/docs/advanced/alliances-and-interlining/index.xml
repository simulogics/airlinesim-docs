 Alliances
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#alliances">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways to connect with other players in-game, you may consider joining an alliance. What&amp;rsquo;s that about, you ask?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alliances are formal business cooperation agreements between a number of companies. They add a taste of reality to the game and are a great way to enjoy AirlineSim with your fellow players. The goals of an alliance, its membership criteria and other formalities are decided internally by its members.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interlining</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/alliances-and-interlining/interlining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/alliances-and-interlining/interlining/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="interlining">
 Interlining
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#interlining">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Another way of forming connections with other players is through interlining. This concept refers to agreements between airlines regarding passenger transfers; specifically, the ability for passengers to transfer between flights operated by airlines which have interlining agreements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a pretty complicated business in reality, but a simplified model is used in AirlineSim.&lt;/p>

 How to Get Started
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#how-to-get-started">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order for passenger transfers between flights operated by two different airlines to occur, an interlining contract must be signed. These contracts currently encompass the entire networks of the involved airlines - there are no restrictions regarding particular airports or routes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
