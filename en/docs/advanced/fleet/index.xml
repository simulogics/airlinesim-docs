 Maintenance Categories
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#maintenance-categories">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Every aircraft type in AirlineSim has a distinct maintenance category which describes its capability of being maintained together with similar types, e.g. an Airbus A318 together with an A319, A320 or A321. This refers to similar needs regarding training and equipment due to technical similarities between the planes. You can check which category an aircraft belongs to by having a look at its fact sheet.&lt;/p>

 Fuel Consumption
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#fuel-consumption">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Fuel isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap. Every dollar you pay for fuel reduces your profit, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to use the right plane for the right route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fuel_01.png" alt="Fuel Graph (Markets and Exchanges page)" title="Fuel Graph"/>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the game, the two main factors regarding fuel consumption are fuel per flight and fuel per kilometer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fuel per flight (or per cycle) is used for taxiing, take-off, climbing to cruise altitude and landing. The fuel per kilometer covers the distance between the airports as long as that distance is less than the minimum range of the plane - flying further means carrying (and using) more fuel and transporting less passengers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
