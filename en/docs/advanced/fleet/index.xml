This refers to similar needs regarding training and equipment due to technical similarities between the planes. You can check which category an aircraft belongs to by having a look at its fact sheet.
While an A320 and an A318 do not differ much, a Boeing 737 is a wholly different plane with different requirements.</description></item><item><title>Fuel Consumption</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/fuel-consumption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/fuel-consumption/</guid><description>Fuel Consumption # Fuel isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap. Every dollar you pay for fuel reduces your profit, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to use the right plane for the right route.
In the game, the two main factors regarding fuel consumption are fuel per flight and fuel per kilometer.
The fuel per flight (or per cycle) is used for taxiing, take-off, climbing to cruise altitude and landing. The fuel per kilometer covers the distance between the airports as long as that distance is less than the minimum range of the plane - flying further means carrying (and using) more fuel and transporting less passengers.</description></item></channel></rss>
