What&amp;rsquo;s that about, you ask?
Alliances are formal business cooperation agreements between a number of companies. They add a taste of reality to the game and are a great way to enjoy AirlineSim with your fellow players. The goals of an alliance, its membership criteria and other formalities are decided internally by its members.</description></item><item><title>Company Overview</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/user-interface/company-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/user-interface/company-overview/</guid><description>Company Overview # Hovering over your company&amp;rsquo;s name at the top left of the screen provides you with several options regarding your enterprise.

Use a set of comprehensive management tools to set up an aircraft fleet, create cabin configurations and schedule flight plans – all while keeping an eye on the game&amp;rsquo;s real time market and adjusting price and service levels if necessary.
It&amp;rsquo;s not all about competition, though: From forming alliances to signing interline agreements and leasing out aircraft – in AirlineSim, you have many ways of interacting with other players and forming connections that last.</description></item><item><title>General</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/faqs/general/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/faqs/general/</guid><description>General # What is AirlineSim about? # AirlineSim is a browser-based business simulation in which you can create your own virtual airline and compete for passengers in a market that operates in real time. See Game Concept for more details.
How much does it cost? # The game employs a pay-to-play payment system that requires the purchase of credits. If this is your first time playing AirlineSim, your new account will be equipped with 60 credits that cover a trial period of about two weeks.</description></item><item><title>Holdings vs. Subsidiaries</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/setup/holdings-vs-subsidiaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/setup/holdings-vs-subsidiaries/</guid><description>Holdings vs. Subsidiaries # When you start out with a new company, you create a holding in the country of your choice and receive a capital of 10 million AS$ (please note that the amount of starting capital can vary depending on the game world). Using that, you can acquire planes and become an operational enterprise. However, you can also use your funds (or parts of them) to create a subsidiary.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/beginners-guide/introduction/</guid><description>Your First Airline # You&amp;rsquo;re new to the game and want to know how to get started with your business venture? Well, you have come to the right place!
This tutorial is here to guide you through your first steps in the game, covering everything from setting up your new company and building your fleet to configuring aircraft cabins and activating flight schedules.
Ready? Then let&amp;rsquo;s get your airline off the ground!</description></item><item><title>Load Factors</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/finances/load-factors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/finances/load-factors/</guid><description>Load Factors # A plane that flies half empty loses money, so make sure to keep your planes as full as possible. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough payload, you need another plane making profit in order to cover for the losses. However, this means that you invested money in two planes and the net result is still zero.
Example
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have a plane with 100 seats and the point where you break even is at around 70%.</description></item><item><title>Maintenance Categories</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/maintenance-categories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/maintenance-categories/</guid><description>Maintenance Categories # Every aircraft type in AirlineSim has a distinct maintenance category which describes its capability of being maintained together with similar types, e.g. an Airbus A318 together with an A319, A320 or A321. This refers to similar needs regarding training and equipment due to technical similarities between the planes. You can check which category an aircraft belongs to by having a look at its fact sheet.
While an A320 and an A318 do not differ much, a Boeing 737 is a wholly different plane with different requirements.</description></item><item><title>Online Reservation System</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/online-reservation-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/online-reservation-system/</guid><description>Online Reservation System # As one of the game&amp;rsquo;s core features, the Online Reservation System (ORS) generates a multitude of daily connections and distributes passengers between the players&amp;rsquo; flights.
Flights are put into the ORS three days before they take off. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you activate a flight plan on Monday morning and the first flight is scheduled to take off at 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock. In that case, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait until 11 o&amp;rsquo;clock before your first flight appears on the flight list.</description></item><item><title>Signing Up</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/account-management/account-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/account-management/account-creation/</guid><description>Signing Up # Before accessing the game, you need to set up an account by selecting the Login button on the AirlineSim website.

While you can use the first holding you establish as a regular airline, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to perform a stock market launch with it. In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested in starting an IPO, you need to create another enterprise as the daughter of your existing holding.</description></item><item><title>Deactivation</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/account-management/account-deactivation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/account-management/account-deactivation/</guid><description>Deactivation # If you ever decide to close your account, please send a support ticket via email so we can deactivate the account for you.
Warning
An account deactivation affects both your AirlineSim and Prosperous Universe account. In case you only want to remove your account from an AirlineSim game world, just navigate to the world&amp;rsquo;s Settings tab and click on Deactivation. This will irreversibly delete all of your account&amp;rsquo;s holdings and subsidiaries, so please read the details provided on the page carefully before proceeding.</description></item><item><title>Demand Calculation</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/demand/</guid><description>Demand Calculation # To help you get a better understanding of how demand works in AirlineSim, here is a general Q&amp;amp;A.
Does the time of day matter when it comes to flights? # No, passengers will treat all flight departure and arrival times equally. Total travel time does affect the flight rating, though.
Does passenger demand vary seasonally? # No, seasonal changes currently don&amp;rsquo;t play a role when it comes to demand.</description></item><item><title>Development</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/about/development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/about/development/</guid><description>Development # AirlineSim # The development of the original game began back in January 2002. Five years later, simulogics was founded and what started out as a hobby soon turned into a full-fledged game project. Over the years, AirlineSim has seen a lot of progress, including game world releases, in-game improvements and last but not least, a steadily growing community.
AirlineSim Technology Demonstrator # In December 2021, the team announced a project called the AirlineSim Technology Demonstrator (ASTD).</description></item><item><title>Fuel Consumption</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/fuel-consumption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/fleet/fuel-consumption/</guid><description>Fuel Consumption # Fuel isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap. Every dollar you pay for fuel reduces your profit, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to use the right plane for the right route.
In the game, the two main factors regarding fuel consumption are fuel per flight and fuel per kilometer.
The fuel per flight (or per cycle) is used for taxiing, take-off, climbing to cruise altitude and landing. The fuel per kilometer covers the distance between the airports as long as that distance is less than the minimum range of the plane - flying further means carrying (and using) more fuel and transporting less passengers.</description></item><item><title>Interlining</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/alliances-and-interlining/interlining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/alliances-and-interlining/interlining/</guid><description>Interlining # Another way of forming connections with other players is through interlining. This concept refers to agreements between airlines regarding passenger transfers; specifically, the ability for passengers to transfer between flights operated by airlines which have interlining agreements.
This is a pretty complicated business in reality, but a simplified model is used in AirlineSim.
How to Get Started # In order for passenger transfers between flights operated by two different airlines to occur, an interlining contract must be signed.</description></item><item><title>Payments</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/faqs/payments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/faqs/payments/</guid><description>Payments # This article is meant to help you with possible questions regarding the payment process for AirlineSim credits.
Missing Payment Methods # Right now, AirlineSim offers five different payment methods during checkout:
Credit or Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) PayPal paysafecard Online Bank Transfer Prepayment Which ones are available to you can depend on your country as well as the credit package you picked. If a payment method doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up, try selecting another package size.</description></item><item><title>Ticket Prices</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/finances/ticket-prices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/finances/ticket-prices/</guid><description>Ticket Prices # How much will passengers pay? # Actually, the answer is fairly simple: If you&amp;rsquo;re the only airline in the area, passengers will pay through the nose to board your planes. They may hate you for it, but they will pay. However, you&amp;rsquo;re rarely the only available airline, so here are a few rules of thumb to guide you through the process of choosing ticket prices.
If you&amp;rsquo;re offering decent seats and service, you can try selling tickets that lie 25% above the default price.</description></item><item><title>Traffic Rights</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/setup/traffic-rights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/setup/traffic-rights/</guid><description>Traffic Rights # A critical aspect of the game is that airlines are national, not global, entities. Air traffic agreements between individual countries regulate the transport of passengers in the real world and AirlineSim represents this, albeit in a slightly simplified manner.
What are Traffic Rights? # By Traffic Rights we mean the rules that determine whether you can fly passengers between two destinations. Your rights to serve a particular market are determined by the country in which your holding&amp;rsquo;s home base is located.</description></item><item><title>Flight Rating System</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/flight-rating-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/advanced/bookings/flight-rating-system/</guid><description>Flight Rating System # The Flight Rating System (FRS) is designed to provide airlines with a detailed quality evaluation of individual flights. The ratings it provides are also used to calculate the influence a flight has on the airline&amp;rsquo;s image.
The evaluation can be accessed via the Inventory or Flight Numbers page in the Commercial tab. Just click on the small white arrow next to a flight and you&amp;rsquo;ll see its Flight Information page.</description></item><item><title>Game Worlds</title><link>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/about/game-worlds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.airlinesim.aero/en/docs/about/game-worlds/</guid><description>Game Worlds # After logging into your account, the Dashboard will show a variety of game worlds for you to choose from.
